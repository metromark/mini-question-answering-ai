Mujiv Hataman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao turned over the ARMM government to the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) in a simple but emotional event here yesterday. The turnover of ARMM to Al Hajj Murad Ebrahim, interim chief minister of BTA, signaled the start of its replacement with the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). In an emotional speech, Hataman said he is confident that the BARMM will be a good vehicle for the attainment of lasting peace and sustainable development in its core territory – all five provinces of the ARMM. “Let us now unite, do away with tribalism, let the Yakans, Maguindanaons, Meranaos, Tausug and Samah people and the lumads unite now under this Bangsamoro government,” Hataman said. Hataman’s speech was punctuated with chants of “Allahu Akbar” by members of the BTA whom President Duterte swore into office last Friday. The BARMM will also cover Cotabato City, originally under Region 12. The city will serve as the Bangsamoro regional capital. Hataman and members of his Cabinet campaigned extensively for the ratification of BARMM’s charter, Republic Act 11054, or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), during a plebiscite last Jan. 21. The plebiscite was held in the ARMM’s component-provinces, Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur and the island provinces of Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi and in Cotabato City. Hataman, whose second term as ARMM governor is to end on June 30 yet, said he has decided not to join the transitory bloc led by Ebrahim so he can return to his home province of Basilan and focus on local humanitarian and security programs meant to complement the fragile peace in the province. The BARMM is a product of 22 years of peace talks between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) that Ebrahim leads as figurehead of its central leadership core. The transition rites were held at the 300-seat Shariff Kabunsuan Cultural Complex inside the 33-hectare ARMM regional capitol in Cotabato City. The event was facilitated by Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr. Galvez lauded Hataman for his administration’s governance, infrastructure and socio-economic feats while at the helm of ARMM. The turnover of ARMM to the MILF-led BTA was witnessed by members of Hataman’s now defunct regional Cabinet and military officials led by Lt. Gen. Arnel dela Vega of the Western Mindanao Command and the commander of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division, Major Gen. Cirilito Sobejana. Ebrahim, for his part, said his leadership of the BARMM interim parliament will focus on pressing concerns besetting its territory – illiteracy, poverty and corruption in the bureaucracy. Ebrahim said he will oversee in concurrent capacity the BARMM’s public works ministry. “I shall be responsible for leading a morally upright government,” the MILF leader said. Ebrahim said members of the BARMM interim parliament also swore over the Qur’an to shun corruption and tribalism in managing its ministries and in discharging their functions as BTA officials. The BTA will manage on caretaker basis the BARMM pending the election of its first set of officials in 2022. A group of learned Muslim leaders said the success or failure of the BTA hinges mainly on how the new Moro leadership handles tribal rivalries and past graft and corrupt practices committed by traditional politicians of the now defunct ARMM. “Brother Ustadz. You are 100 percent correct that peace and unity must be our top priority but corrupt practices and other criminal offenses perpetrated by traditional politicians must be looked into to give meaning to our efforts in the name of good governance,” the group appealed to Ebrahim. The group, describing itself as pro-peace and pro-development, also asked Ebrahim to focus on unifying various Muslim tribes and indigenous peoples in Mindanao. “Uniting these tribes is an uphill battle for the BTA team to accomplish. We are hoping that in three years they can do this job,” a Muslim scholar said. He specifically cited the decades-old differences between the Maranaos and Tausugs. He said the Maranaos considered themselves as descendants of royal blood while Tausugs are known warriors. Tausugs are mostly fighters of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) led by its founder and former ARMM governor Nur Misuari. The MILF, on the other hand, are mostly Maguindanaons and Maranaos. “There’s intense rivalry between the two Muslim groups and for the BARMM to succeed these differences must be addressed by BTA team,” the scholar said. Meanwhile, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) has turned over much-needed facilities worth P4.7 million to farmers in the ARMM. Six hauling trucks and common service facilities were given to agrarian reform beneficiary organizations (ARBO) in the region. The equipment include six hauling trucks, 35 HP tractors with implements, hand tractors, corn shellers, rice threshers, coffee hullers and coffee roasters. These were distributed to the 12 ARBOs in the ARMM: four in Maguindanao and two each in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi and Lanao. DAR regional secretary Dayang Carlsum Jumaide said more than 3,000 agrarian reform beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries will benefit from the machineries. Jumaide added the machinery, provided under the Agrarian Reform Community Connectivity and Economic Support Services and Climate Resilient Farm Productivity Support Project 2018, will address the farmers’ need for transport of their produce to the market, and improve farm productivity to increase the income of agrarian reform beneficiaries through their organizations. Agrarian Secretary John Castriciones said this initiative was in line with President Duterte’s orders to extend support services to the agency’s farmer-beneficiaries. – Jaime Laude, Rhodina Villanueva ARMM turns over power to Bangsamoro authority"

Our jihad will be more intense and more challenging, our jihad firstly will be against our own self,” Murad said, adding “our enemies are all the ills of governance… our enemy is graft and corruption, our enemy is the manipulation of government, our enemy is nepotism, our enemy is all those ills of government.” HAND ON HEART. Secretary Carlito Galvez, Jr., Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation, and Unity, Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, Interim Chief Minister of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and Mujiv Hataman, the last governor of the 28-year old Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao lead the singing of the Philippine National Anthem during the turnover of the ARMM to the BARMM at the Shariff Kabunsuan Cultural Complex in Cotabato City on February 26, 2019. MindaNews photo by MANMAN DEJETOIn his 24-minute speech, Murad said that aside from taking their oath as BTA members before President in Malacanang on February 22, “we will also take oath to Allah, over the Koran, Inshallah. This is to ensure to you that, Inshallah, we will work for a government that will really be free of all the ills of governance.” He told reporters after he was ushered into his new office at the Office of the Bangsamoro People by the previous occupant, Mujiv Hataman — the last Governor of the 28-year old ARMM — that they would hold their inaugural session as BTA sometime in March, that he would reside in the Astana, the Governor’s House inside the ARMM compound, and that he would hold a “People’s Day” every week to listen to and address the concerns of his constituents. He told MindaNews they would swear on the Koran “possibly sa inauguration kasi hindi pa complete ang BTA” (possibly during the inauguration because the BTA is not yet complete). The MILF-led BTA is supposed to be composed of 80 members but in the February 22 oathtaking, only 72 took their oath. One of the MILF’s 41 nominees was unable to attend as she was recuperating from an ailment. Only 32 of the supposed 39 nominees from government took their oath. Malacanang as of Tuesday has not released the final list and the appointment papers of the 80 members.

Jaafar, chair of the now defunct Bangsamoro Transition Commission that drafted the basic law, was absent during the February 26 handover but was present at the oathtaking in Malacanang on February 22, entering Rizal Hall on a wheelchair. But he insisted on standing up during the oathtaking. Murad, Iqbal, Guerra, Macacua, Yacob and Munoz are all members of the MILF Central Committee; Jajurie and Sinarimbo served as members of the legal panel of the MILF peace panel; Ulama was a member of the Bangsamoro Transition Commission from 2013 to 2016 and 2016 to 2019; Dipatuan is Executive Director of the Bangsamoro Development Agency (BDA). Iqbal is chair of the MILF Peace Implementing Panel and Information Chief; Guerra is Chair, Committee on Foreign Affairs and concurrent chair of the Joint Normalization Committee (JNC) on the MILF side; Macacua is Chief of Staff of the soon-to-be-decommissioned Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF); Yacob is BDA Chief Executive Officer and Munoz is Deputy Chief of Staff of the BIAF.

MindaNews photo by MANMAN DEJETOUnder RA 11054 or the Organic Law for the BARMM, the Interim Cabinet shall be composed of 15 primary ministries: Finance, and Budget and Management; Social Services; Trade, Investments, and Tourism; Labor and Employment; Transportation and Communications; Basic, Higher and Technical Education; Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs; Health; Public Works; Local Government; Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy; Human Settlements and Development; Science and Technology; Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform; and Public Order and Safety. Secretary Carlito Galvez, Jr., Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity, stressed the need for “unity in diversity.’ “Just like a rainbow, it is composed of different hues. Each color is uniquely beautiful and has a special purpose. It is reflective of the various tribes and beliefs that co-exist in the Bangsamoro homeland. But we can only maximize its beauty and power if we work harmoniously and collectively,” he said. Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation, and Unity Carlito Galvez, Jr. calls on leaders of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, the body that will govern the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao until June 30, 2022 to “put personal interest behind and work for the common good of the Bangsamoro People” during the turnover rites from ARMM to BARMM at the Shariff Kabunsuan Cultural Complex in Cotabato City on February 26, 2019. MindaNews photo by MANMAN DEJETOGalvez noted that the transition process is a daunting taks but “there are no challenges that we cannot surmount if we all work together as a team.” He urged the new leaders to “put personal interest behind and work for the common good of the Bangsamoro People.” “From individual to organizational, let’s transcend it to societal change in our desire for peace, progress and prosperity. The bottomline here is to bring good governance through clean governmental transaction,” he said. Unleashing the potentials of the Bangsamoro In a 13-minute speech that left the audience teary-eyed, Hataman fought back tears while saying that the Bangsamoro is “lahat ng nanalig na isang araw ay mababawi natin ang ating dangal, at kikilalanin tayo bilang mga taong mayroong dignidad at angking kadakilaan. Tayo ang Bangsamoro” (everyone who believes that one day we will reclaim our honor, and be recognized as people with dignity and greatness. We are the Bangsamoro). He urged the Moro to unite, treat their fellow Moro as allies, as partners in the struggle, to love and trust each other, “dahil alam po nating lahat: Moro ang unang tutulong sa kapwa Moro. Moro ang unang dapat maasahan ng kapwa niya Moro” (because we all know: the Moro will be the first to help the Moro, the Moro can rely on his fellow Moro). He asked his fellow Moro to stop pitting the Moro against the Moro because the Bangsamoro is “iisa” (one) – whether you are Tausug or Mernaaw, Yakan or Maguindanaon or Sama. “I formally close the chapter of the ARMM and open our new chapter as BARMM,” Mujiv Hataman, the last governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao said at the handover rites to Interim Chief Minister Al Haj Murad Ebrahim of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, at the Shariff Kabunsuan Cultural Complex in Cotabato City on February 26, 2019. MindaNews photo by MANMAN DEJETOHataman, who served as OIC ARMM Governor from December 22, 2011 to June 30, 2013 and elected governor from 2013 to 2016 and 2016 to 2019, appealed to his fellow Moro to let go of the old conflicts and forgive, as they begin a new chapter. “We are one, so let us show what a united Bangsamoro can do, let them think: So this is how it is when the full potentials of the Moro are unleashed,” he said in Filipino. “Pormal ko ngayong ipinapasa ang pamunuan sa BTA sa pamumuno ni Interim Chief Minister Al Haj Murad. Pormal kong isinisara ang kabanata ng ARMM, at binubuksan ang ating bagong kabanata ng BARMM,” (I am formally passing on the leadership to the BTA under Interim Chief Minister Al Haj Murad Ebrhaim. I formally close the chapter of the ARMM and open our new chapter as BARMM,” Hataman said. (Carolyn O. Arguillas / MindaNews)"
https://www.manilatimes.net/2019/01/23/news/top-stories/yes-vote-prevails-in-4-of-5-provinces/500640/500640/,"THE “YES” vote took an early and overwhelming lead in the unofficial count for the plebiscite to ratify the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) granting greater autonomy to Muslim Mindanao. But the vote is close in the province of Sulu and the city of Isabela in Basilan, whose leaders are staunchly opposed to the law, based on the results from a monitoring team of the military, police and the Commission on Elections (Comelec). As of 3 p.m., the “yes” votes totaled 1,539,000, while the “no” votes reached only 233,349. The “yes” vote is leading in four out of five provinces in the original Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), which will be replaced by the Bangsamoro autonomous region if the BOL is ratified. In Lanao del Sur, the unofficial count tallied 503,626 “yes” votes and 9,816 “no” votes. Basilan counted 138,569 “yes” votes and 6,589 “no” votes, while Tawi-Tawi had 143,443 “yes” votes and 9,419 “no” votes. In Maguindanao, the unofficial tally stood at 558,489 “yes” votes and 6,400 “no” votes. The “no” vote is also leading in Sulu, with 152,493 votes, against 137,891 “yes” votes. The results were disseminated by the Western Mindanao Command (WestMinCom) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Two cities not originally part of ARMM took part in the plebiscite to vote on whether or not to join the Bangsamoro region. In Cotabato City, which will become the capital of the Bangsamoro region, the “yes” vote won as proclaimed by the Comelec, the WestMinCom said, despite a high-profile campaign by Mayor Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi against the BOL. The final tally was 36,682 “yes” votes and 24,994 “no” votes. But “no” was leading in Isabela City in Basilan with 21,810 votes, against 18,796 “yes” votes, defying the rest of the island which voted overwhelmingly “yes,” based on partial and unofficial results. Survey: Pinoy Muslims back BOL Voter turnout was high at 92.6 percent in Lanao del Sur, 91 percent in Tawi-Tawi, at nearly 80 percent in Sulu, 76 percent in Basilan, 60 percent in Cotabato City, 66.2 percent in Maguindanao, and 58.3 percent in Isabela City, according to WestMinCom. On February 6, another plebiscite will be held. Residents of Lanao del Norte will vote on the inclusion of six towns in the BOL. North Cotabato will also vote on whether or not to include 67 barangay or villages. An overwhelming majority of Muslims nationwide, 79 percent, favored the BOL, a survey by the Social Weather Stations (SWS) found. Only 7 percent opposed the measure. The remaining 14 percent were undecided. SWS also found that 41 percent of Mindanaoans favored the BOL, while 31 percent opposed it. The remaining 28 percent were undecided. The survey was conducted from Dec. 16 to 19, 2018 among 1,440 Filipinos aged 17 years and above. It had sampling error margins of ±2.6 percent for national percentages, and ±5 percent each for Balance Luzon, Metro Manila, the Visayas and Mindanao. Malacañang on Tuesday welcomed the survey, saying it showed that the Bangsamoro people have had enough of war, terrorism and poverty. “The initial unofficial tally of the votes in the plebiscite appears to validate the survey results. We hope that the aspiration of our Muslim brothers and sisters for a peaceful and progressive Bangsamoro region will commence its realization following the ratification of the BOL,” Palace spokesman Salvador Panelo said. Mayor Guiani-Sayadi claimed the plebiscite in Cotabato City was marred by vote-buying, violence and intimidation. She vowed to file charges against vote buyers and those behind election violence. If the BOL succeeds in Cotabato City, she said: “We are going to question that and then the chairman of the Comelec is also a member of the MILF (Moro Islamic Liberation Front).” Sayadi was referring to Comelec chief Sheriff Abas. The plebiscite was the result of a 2014 peace deal between Manila and the MILF, whose leaders are expected to dominate the Bangsamoro government. “Teachers were scared, why do you scare teachers? We wanted them to serve the elections,” she said in an interview over the ABS-CBN News Channel (ANC). MILF Vice Chairman Ghazali Jaafar denied the allegations of fraud hurled by Sayadi, saying the rebel group did not have the resources to buy votes. He admitted, however, that MILF members were in Cotabato City, but only for a visit. “The MILF have thousands of members, not only thousands but millions, and they are free to come to Cotabato City because this is a democratic country,” Jaafar said on ANC. “We also received some kind of threats and intimidation but let the PNP (Philippine National Police) or the Comelec investigate how truthful are these allegations because until it is proven correct, it remains an allegation,” he added. Maj. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of the Philippine Army’s 6th Infantry Division, confirmed that some 6,000 MILF forces were monitored inside the city of Cotabato beginning Sunday. The MILF members left the city proper on Sunday night and returned to their respective areas in Maguindanao, North Cotabato and Sarangani. “There are no monitored planned atrocities from either side of supporters. Slow acceptance of the ‘yes’ vote win is monitored. Comments are mostly on the apprehension on the upcoming changes once the law is finally ratified,” Sobejana said in a statement. Abbas, a nephew of MILF chief peace negotiator Mohagher Iqbal, declined to comment on the reported MILF presence in Cotabato City. “I don’t know, I did not go home. I’m just here in Manila. I can’t comment on that,” he said. The Armed Forces said it would review security measures in preparation for the second BOL plebiscite on February 6. “While we see the first plebiscite as generally peaceful and successful, we cannot just sit and relax on our duties and responsibilities,” said Col. Noel Detoyato, military public affairs chief, in a statement. In Manila, the Comelec en banc convened on Tuesday as the National Plebiscite Board of Canvassers (NPBC) for the final and official canvassing of election results or certificates of canvass (CoCs) from the ARMM, Isabela City in Basilan and Cotabato City. The official start of national canvassing was deferred to 1 p.m. on Wednesday following confirmation by the Comelec secretariat that it had yet to receive CoCs from the plebiscite board of canvassers. Abbas said that except for some isolated incidents in Cotabato City, the plebiscite went smoothly. The Comelec regional director reported seven incidents in Cotabato City, which included a grenade-throwing incident at the compound of a regional trial court judge. Abbas also said the plebiscite was viewed by observers as credible. “Of course it was credible. Lente said it was credible, international observers also said that it was credible. On our side, it was the same. There were no untoward incidents except for minor commotions in Cotabato City,” he added. Official canvassing of votes might take a week to finish, he said. For the January 21 plebiscite, the NPBC is expecting to receive a total of four CoCs. They will come from the regional plebiscite boards of canvassers (RPBCs) of the ARMM, from Basilan for the inclusion of Isabela City, from Isabela City and from Cotabato City. For the second plebiscite on February 6, the NPBC will canvass eight CoCs from Lanao del Norte, except Iligan City, covering the municipalities of Baloi, Monai, Nunungan, Pantar, Taguilowan and Pangkal, and seven CoCs from the towns of Aleosan, Carmen, Kabacan, Midsayap, Pikit, and Pigkawayan, including Tolanan, all from North Cotabato. Abbas said that if the “yes” vote win in the ARMM, which is voting as a region, the Comelec would remove the positions at stake for the May 13 local elections. The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) on Tuesday underscored the potential economic contribution of the Bangsamoro region. In a statement, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said the ratification of the BOL through a plebiscite would increase investments in the region and the rest of the country. “Given that the BOL provides a lot of opportunities to increase the budget for [Bangsamoro region], we expect to see more programs and infrastructure projects in the region,” Pernia, who is also the NEDA director general, said. An estimated P70 billion for 2019 alone will be provided by the national government, as assistance to the region. This does not include compensation for the members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, benefits and entitlements of affected ARMM regional government employees, disposition of personnel and assets, initial funding to carry out requirements of the transition, and additional development programs and projects subsidized by the national government. Pernia also cited planned major infrastructure projects in the region amounting to P22.15 billion for 2019 alone and P40.85 billion for 2017-2022, based on the Public Investment Program, as of September 2018. Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri said he was “overjoyed” with the impending creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (Barmm) under the BOL. “Today, with the overwhelming affirmative votes for the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law, we are finally seeing Mindanao shed its history of conflict and enter an age of peace and progress,” Zubiri said in a speech on the Senate floor.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1076036/zubiri-overwhelming-yes-vote-for-bol-shows-mindanao-shedding-its-history-of-conflict,"MANILA, Philippines — With the “overwhelming” affirmative votes for the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), the country is finally seeing Mindanao “shed its history of conflict and enter an age of peace and progress,” Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri said Tuesday. In a privilege speech during the Senate session on Tuesday, Zubiri lauded the turnout of the BOL plebiscite held Monday. ADVERTISEMENT“[Ang] Bangsamoro Organic Law, ay sinagot po ng malakas at umaapaw na “YES” vote ng ating mga kapatid na Muslim at Kristiyano sa Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (The Bangsamoro Organic Law was met with overwhelming ‘yes’ votes from our Muslim and Christian brothers in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao),” Zubiri said in his privilege speech. “With the overwhelming affirmative votes for the ratification of the BOL, we are finally seeing Mindanao shed its history of conflict and enter an age of peace and progress,” he added. Zubiri said the latest and unofficial count of the Bangsamoro Free Election Movement (BFEM), a Commission on Elections-accredited citizen’s arm in the plebiscite, showed that 657,113 individuals in the ARMM voted for the approval of the BOL compared to the 49,304 who voted against it. “The ‘yes’ votes is 93 percent of the total votes cast, while the ‘no’ (vote) is a measly 7 percent,” Zubiri said. The senator noted that the voter turn-out was estimated at 70 percent, which is the highest voter turn-out for the organic law in the region compared to the 1989, 2001 plebiscites. He also said that in the latest tally of the BFEM in Cotabato City, 34,858 voted in favor of the approval of BOL while 21,757 voted against it. Zubiri said the BOL “will put an end to the cycle of war and destruction that Muslim Mindanao has suffered for more than a hundred years.” “We want the whole of Mindanao, both Muslim and non-Muslim areas, to be in step with the rest of the Philippines and attain prosperity and liberties to the extent that they can implement their aspirations with the help of the National Government and within the bounds of our Constitution,” he added. /ee ADVERTISEMENTDon't miss out on the latest news and information.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/01/25/19/new-era-dawns-for-bangsamoro-as-stronger-autonomy-law-ratified,"MANILA (2nd UPDATE) — The new law for the Muslim minority in southern Philippines was ratified Friday night, paving the way for the creation of a more powerful, self-governing autonomous region that will seek to clamp down on violent extremism and address chronic poverty there. Residents of the current Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which will implement a 2014 peace agreement between the government and the largest Muslim rebel group in the country. A total of 1,540,017 residents voted for ratification while only 198,750 rejected the BOL. “The Comelec, sitting en banc as the National Plebiscite Board of Canvassers hereby proclaims... the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao as deemed ratified, considering that majority of votes cast in all provinces and cities in the present ARMM, voting as one geographic area, is in favor of the approval of the organic law,” poll body chairman Sheriff Abas announced. The new region will be composed of the existing 5 provinces of ARMM, and Cotabato City, in what is considered a crucial victory for the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). A second round of the plebiscite on Feb. 6 will determine whether the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) would still be expanded. The plebiscite will cover 6 towns in Lanao Del Norte and 39 villages in North Cotabato. Another 28 barangays from the province were allowed to choose if they want to be part of the new region. Cotabato City voted to be part of the BARMM in a highly contentious plebiscite marred by allegations of vote-buying, voter disenfranchisement, and harassment by MILF combatants. A total of 36,682 voted for inclusion, while 24,994 voted against it. The 54.22-percent voter turnout in the city was below the regional average of 85 percent. Two previous plebiscites saw Cotabato City rejecting the option to be part of the ARMM - first in 1989 and again in 2001. Isabela City in Basilan again voted against inclusion. The total affirmative votes were 19,032 compared to 22,441 votes against joining the new region. Its mother unit, the province of Basilan, voted in favor of the city being part of the BARMM. The affirmative votes totaled 144,640 and the negative votes 8,487. But since the BOL required a “double majority” — meaning both the city and the province should vote in the affirmative — Isabela City will remain outside of the BARMM. Raissa Jajurie, a lawyer for the Bangsamoro Transition Commission, called attention to reports of alleged “erasures” and discrepancies in some 80 plebiscite returns in Isabela City. The National Board of Canvassers took note of the concern and proceeded to the tabulation. The province of Sulu also voted against the ratification of the BOL. But since the ARMM voted as one geographical area, the rest of its provinces ovewhelmed the Sulu vote. Sulu Gov. Abdusakur Tan II earlier questioned the constitutionality of the BOL before the Supreme Court. His petition criticized the absence of an option in the BOL to allow current ARMM areas, such as Sulu, to “opt out” of the new autonomous region. The MILF will lead the Bangsamoro’s transition government until the region’s first regular election in 2022. Vice President Leni Robredo on Friday said the ratification of the BOL was a ""historic victory"" for the Filipino people. ""Ang pagraratipika ng Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) ay isang makasaysayang tagumpay na dapat ipagmalaki ng lahat ng Pilipino, lalo na ng mga kapatid nating mula sa Mindanao,"" Robredo said in a statement. ""Bantayan at suportahan natin ang patuloy na pagsulong ng prosesong ito, dahil hindi pa dito nagtatapos ang laban para sa kapayapaan. Buong-buo ang aking pananalig na kapayapaan ang magdadala sa bawat mamamayan ng Bangsamoro ng magandang buhay."" The European Union Delegation in the Philippines, meanwhile, called the creation of the BARMM ""a significant milestone in the history of the Philippines."" ""The European Union has been a staunch supporter of the Mindanao Peace Process throughout the years, expressing its political support, encouraging all sides to pursue a peaceful solution and providing substantial financial support for the process,"" it said in a statement. The EU Delegation vowed to continue its support for the implementation of the BOL for ""long-lasting peace, development and prosperity for the benefit of Mindanao and the Filipino people."""

The plebiscite for BOL ratification is set for Jan. 21 and Feb. 6. —JEOFFREY MAITEM/ INQUIRER FILE PHOTO MIDSAYAP, NORTH COTABATO — The canvassing of plebiscite returns from the towns of Pigcawayan, Aleosan, Carmen and Tulunan, North Cotabato have been completed as of 10:25 a.m. Thursday, with 21 of the 67 villages joining the new Bangsamoro region, a Commission on Elections (Comelec) official said. In a press briefing here shortly before noontime, lawyer Michael Abas, Comelec-12 director, said the counting of votes and the canvassing of election returns went smoothly in the province after polling centers closed at 3 p.m. Wednesday. ADVERTISEMENTAbout 90 percent of the election returns have been canvassed, he added. Results of the canvassing in Pikit, Midsayap, and Kabacan were expected to be completed in the day, Abas said. He placed the voters’ turnout at 54 percent. On Wednesday, Abas said, “We would be lucky if voters’ turnout reached 60 percent.” Fr. David Brocalla, coordinator for Mindanao of the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV), said the conduct of the plebiscite in North Cotabato was peaceful, crediting the military and the police for the orderly outcome. The PPCRV conducted monitoring but not a quick count of votes. Brocalla also lauded the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) for their efforts to ensure a clean and orderly plebiscite. Von Alhaq, MILF spokesperson, said the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF), the MILF’s armed wing, guarded the fringes of remote communities against possible saboteurs during the plebiscite. Authorities earlier raised the possibility the BIAF would spoil the exercise. ADVERTISEMENTWithout giving actual numbers, Abas said Tulunan voted no against the inclusion of Barangay Galidan to the BARMM. In Tulunan, Barangays Dunguan and Tapodoc would be part of the BARMM while Barangays Lower Mingading and Pagangan voted against inclusion, Abas said. In Carmen town, seven villages would join the BARMM while 12 villages in Pigcawayan also voted the same, the official said. Citing partial results in the towns of Pikit, Aleosan, and Kabacan, Abas said, “many villages are poised to join the BARMM.” Pikit has 23 villages that wished to join BARMM; 13 villages in Midsayap; and seven villages in Kabacan. Abas said the completed canvassed plebiscite returns would be flown to Manila on Friday and submitted to the National Plebiscite Board of Canvassers./lzb Don't miss out on the latest news and information.

Divina M. Suson TUBOD, Lanao del Norte — Thirteen towns in Lanao del Norte province voted No to the inclusion of six towns in the Bangsamoro. Nine towns, including the six, proposed to join the new territory, voted Yes, according to the final and unofficial results of the plebiscite released by the Joint Task Force Plebisito here on Thursday. ADVERTISEMENTAmong the 14 towns whose plebiscite returns have been canvassed, so far, No garnered a total of 157,629 votes against the 81,542 votes for Yes. This meant that the six towns proposed for inclusion wanted to join the Bangsamoro, and three other towns backed them up, but other towns in the province do not want to let go. Among the towns where the Yes votes had an overwhelming win were Munai, Nunungan, Pantar, Tagoloan, Baloi, and Tangkal, which were proposed for inclusion in the Bangsamoro; and the neighboring Pantao Ragat, Poona Piagapo, and Salvador towns. The No won in the towns of Kauswagan, Linamon, Matungao, Bacolod, Baroy, Kapatagan, Kolambogan, Lala, Maigo, Magsaysay, Sultan Naga Dimaporo, Sapad, and Tubod. Lanao del Norte, which has a total of 334,356 registered voters, posted an election turnout of 71.53 percent, election officials said. The canvassing was slightly delayed because the election returns from the coastal town of Linamon took a long time to arrive. /lzb Don't miss out on the latest news and information.

https://www.voanews.com/a/autonomy-philippine-muslims/4502200.html,"MARAWI CITY, PHILIPPINES - A landmark local autonomy law passed this week in the Philippine capital, Manila, gives restive Muslim Filipinos a new sense of hope for resolving a half-century-old conflict over self-rule that has killed 120,000 people and attracted the terrorist group Islamic State. The Bangsamoro Organic Law received full congressional approval and the president’s signature in the Philippines this week. It follows up a peace deal signed with the most established separatist group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. The law will give state funding and local control of natural resources to a largely Muslim region on the southern island of Mindanao. The law has widespread support in Mindanao, though Muslims warn that the region’s numerous ethnic and separatist groups must share power for it to work. Perceptions of unequal local leadership and lack of commitment by Manila have hurt an existing autonomy regime in Mindanao, they say. “I share the hope they can achieve their aspirations but of course as one country, not as a separate or even independent area within the Philippines,” said Asec Felix Castro, field office manager with a government agency in charge of rebuilding the Mindanao city of Marawi. FILE - A sign that reads ""I love Marawi"" is seen iFILE - A sign that reads ""I love Marawi"" is seen in front of damaged houses, buildings and a mosque inside a war-torn Marawi city, southern Philippines, Oct. 26, 2017. Troops in Marawi battled an Islamic State-inspired Muslim separatist group for five months, killing about 1,100 people and demolishing the city. Marawi will fall under the new autonomous region. “I’d like to think they can achieve their hope with the proper leadership from among themselves,” Castro said. Control over resources, funding Muslims have lived in Mindanao’s west and its outlying islands for more than 500 years. Many resent the Christian majority’s control over minerals and fossil fuels from their resource-rich part of the archipelago. The new law creates an autonomous region within the Philippines called Bangsamoro. Bangsamoro will replace an existing 12,536 square-kilometer tract carved out for Muslim groups in Mindanao 29 years ago. A voter referendum later this year could expand the region’s boundary. Bangsamoro will automatically get government block grants equal to 5 percent of national tax and customs revenue. Now the region’s leaders must apply for funding. The central government also will kick in 5 billion pesos ($93.6 million) annually for 10 years for the rehabilitation of conflict areas. All central money for development of natural resources will go to the Bangsamoro government, per the new law. Revenue from coal, gas, oil and uranium will be equally shared with the Philippine government. The new region may be able to raise its own taxes, some people in Marawi believe. Bangsamoro leaders will not keep a separate military. Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, chairman of the Moro IslamicAl Haj Murad Ebrahim, chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, gestures as he answers questions from reporters, Manila, Philippines, July 24, 2018. Ebrahim, leader of the largest Muslim rebel group in the Philippines, says 30,000 to 40,000 armed fighters will have to be decommissioned if the autonomy law is fully enforced. A sense of autonomy for Muslims should make Mindanao safer, said Henelito Sevilla, assistant international relations professor at University of the Philippines. Violence occurs so often that foreign governments advise against travel to Mindanao, leaving the island a reputation that has hurt tourism and investment. “The self-determination that they are longing for in terms of practicing their own religion and cultural rights, as well as the exploitation of their own resources, that would bring growth and development, and of course which follows is security in their Muslim areas,” Sevilla said. Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels celebrMoro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels celebrate the signing of the peace agreement during a rally at Camp Darapanan, Sultan Kudarat town, in southern island of Mindanao, March 27, 2014. Congress was set to pass the law in 2015 but stopped after the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ambushed troops and killed 44 commandos. Duterte, himself from Mindanao, had pushed Congress to pass the law this year. “I really plead for peace,” Duterte said Friday via the presidential website. “I do not want war. I cannot fight my own people.” People in Marawi expressed tentative hope. “Autonomy for me is that complete internal sovereignty where the people could practice what they want, wherein they are given the freedom to choose,” said Hamsiya Alilaya, a faculty member with the King Faisal Center for Islamic, Arabic and Asian Studies at Mindanao State University in Marawi. Power sharing among factions in Bangsamoro will help determine whether it works out, analysts in the country say. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front has accepted the law and vowed to disarm 30,000 people, according to Philippine news reports. The front must share power to avoid inciting new insurgencies, Philippine scholars believe. Twenty rebel groups, including a violent one that split from the liberation front, operate today in Mindanao. Government officials must show sincerity in enforcing the Bangsamoro law as well, said Habib Macaayong, president of the Mindanao State University system. Another major rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front, wants the law to give job placements and scholarships for people in Bangsamoro, a group representative said last month. The law should inspire the Moro front to shun any further violence but may form just the first of numerous measures needed to lock in peace, said Enrico Cau, Ph.D. student in international affairs and strategic studies at Tamkang University in Taiwan."

http://www.bantayog.org/lucman-haroun-al-rashid/,"Rashid Lucman’s illustrious ancestors include Sharif Kabungsuan and Angintabu, daughter of the chieftain of Malabang, Lanao del Sur, who bore Rashid Lucman’s father, Sharif Maka‑alang (who succeeded as chieftain). He fought under the US Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) during World War II, organizing the first guerrilla force in Mindanao which fought fierce battles against the Japanese. His war record led to his appointment as deputy governor for Lanao del Sur in 1944. He worked in 1949 as newspaper correspondent for the Manila Chronicle but returned to politics in 1953. He was elected congressman of Lanao del Sur in 1961 and served until 1969. He also served as regional development officer of the Convention on National Integration at Marawi City from 1959 to 1961. He served as Lanao del Sur congressman from 1961 to 1969. As deputy governor, Lucman worked for the surrender of loose firearms in his province and helped bring in the Tausug outlaw Kamlon in the 1950s. He helped rescue non‑Muslims and Subanons from what was then a flourishing slave trade in Mindanao. In 1968, Lucman, then already a congressman, called for the impeachment of President Ferdinand Marcos for the latter’s responsibility in what later came to be known as the Jabidah massacre. It turned out that the Philippine government had secretly trained Muslims to implement a clandestine plan to invade the island of Sabah. The Muslim trainees had rebelled over miserable training conditions in Corregidor island. As a result, 68 Tausug trainees were killed. Lucman failed to generate the support he expected from Congress, and became convinced that Muslims should rule themselves in Muslim Mindanao. He supported the training of young Muslim men for armed resistance and raised funds abroad, particularly from Muslim countries, for Muslim self-rule. He sent young men to be trained in guerrilla warfare under a special Malaysian force. Among them was Nur Misuari, later to become the guerrilla leader of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). He chaired the Union of Islamic Forces and Organization from 1968 to 1972 and at the same time was a member of the Military Council. He also chaired the Supreme Revolutionary Council from 1970 to 1972, and the Bangsa Moro Liberation Organization (BMLO) from 1976 to 1984. The BMLO later joined forces with Nur Misuari’s MNLF. In 1974, Lucman was declared second paramount sultan of Mindanao and Sulu. Here he raised the call for self‑rule for the Bangsa Moro of Mindanao. Lucman left for Saudi Arabia in 1976. In 1984, he was elected vice‑president of the Ninoy Aquino Movement (NAM) in San Francisco, California. He pursued his campaign for unity among Muslim members of the various opposition political forces, including the underground resistance movement led by the Left and Filipino opposition groups in Europe, the Middle East and the United States. He died in Riyadh in 1984. * Father : Sharif Maka‑alang * Spouse: Princess Tarhata Alonto‑Lucman * Education : Associate in Arts, 3 years of law This entry was posted in Martyrs and Heroes .

Fighting lasted until September 28 (6+ killed, 24 wounded). [2] The Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) is an Islamic separatist organization based in the southern Philippines that seeks autonomy for Filipino Muslims, called Moros. The MNLF was established in 1972, and it led the Moro separatist movement until the 1996 Final Peace Agreement between the MNLF and the Philippine government. Since 1996, the MNLF has been surpassed in strength and influence by its rival group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which began its own peace talks with the Philippine government. Today, the MNLF consists of many factions, some of which support current negotiations between the Philippine government and the MILF. The Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) is an Islamic separatist organization based in the southern Philippines. Its stated purpose was to create an independent Islamic state or autonomous region for the Filipino Muslim minority, known as the Moro people, who live primarily in the Philippines’ Mindanao region. For about two decades beginning in the 1970s, the MNLF was the leading organization in the Moro separatist movement. [3] The MNLF is a splinter group of the Muslim Independence Movement (MIM), later called the Mindanao Independence Movement. The MIM was founded in May 1968 in the wake of the Jabidah Massacre (also called the Corregidor Massacre), in which the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) killed an unknown number of Moro Muslims who had been trained as soldiers for a coming military operation. The exact circumstances are debated, and the government only acknowledged the event in 2013. [4] After its founding, the MIM was largely a political movement whose primary activity was issuing manifestos that advocated for a separate Moro state in the southern Philippines. The group allegedly also established an armed wing called the Blackshirts, which fought against Christian militants. MIM members – like other Moros – also participated in revolts against the Philippine government. [5] Beginning around 1969, Malaysia started providing training and arms to Filipino Muslims, which included MIM members. Though supported by external partners, the MIM never gained popular support among the Moros. It remained a loose, weak movement with little recorded activity and under high military pressure from the government. In 1970, MIM leadership agreed to disband after a meeting with then-President Ferdinand Marcos. [6] Afterwards, traditional Moro elites established a second organization, the Bangsa Moro Liberation Organization (BMLO), which was largely comprised of older MIM elites and MIM student leaders. However, the BMLO was soon destroyed by internal conflict fueled by the enduring generational differences among its members. In October 1972, the leaders of the younger generation officially founded the MNLF in Pulau Pangkor, Malaysia. [7] The young leaders distrusted the older Moro elites whom they viewed as antiquated and corrupt, and they used the MNLF to separately pursue the same goal of an independent Moro state. Nur Misuari, an early student leader of the movement, became the MNLF’s first chairman. [8] President Marcos declared martial law in September 1972, citing violence between Muslims and Christians as well as the existence of an illegal separatist movement. This action curtailed Moro political activity and increased government power. After this declaration, the scattered Moro revolts against the state that had been occurring for years escalated to war. [9] Under martial law, state forces dissolved well-established Moro political groups and confiscated all firearms used by rebel forces and non-state actors. As a result, the leading Moro groups deteriorated, and the newly formed and more radical MNLF was quickly able to dominate the Moro separatist movement. Previously disparate rebel forces that had fought separately against the Philippine government and armed Christian groups began to unite under the banner of the MNLF. The MNLF was particularly attractive to former rebels because the group’s leadership, mostly located in Malaysia, was able to provide a steady supply of weapons from abroad. These weapons were then used to engage local state forces and Christian militias in traditional warfare. [10] Significant foreign support came from Libya, which had historically supported the Moro cause. Around the time of the MNLF’s establishment, Misuari and another key MNLF leader, Hashim Salamat, traveled to Libya and successfully persuaded the Libyan government to shift its support away from traditional Moro elites and toward the MNLF. In response, many Moro fighters soon joined or aligned with the MNLF, greatly unifying the separatist movement. [11] In 1973, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) began a massive military operation to quell the Moro separatists, including the MNLF. After the MNLF suffered major defeats in conventional battles against the AFP, military advisors from Libya and Malaysia helped the group adopt guerrilla tactics, which proved more effective against government forces. Simultaneously with the AFP’s offensive, the MNLF solidified its organizational structure. In 1974, MNLF leaders living in Libya established the MNLF’s Central Committee. The Committee was originally composed of thirteen members led by Misuari. The MNLF also made several other organizational changes, including establishing an armed wing called the Bangsa Moro Army (BMA) or the Bangsamoro Armed Forces (BAF), a Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal, and a National Congress. [12] However, these components were not equally active or effective. The National Congress—which was supposed to act as a legislative body within the MNLF—was almost never convened, and the MNLF developed as a centralized rather than a consultative organization under Misuari’s leadership. [13] In 1974, the MNLF released a manifesto that used nationalist claims and rhetoric to justify a separate Moro state, as opposed to the religious motivations that might have been expected from the organization. [14] The manifesto scarcely mentioned Islam despite the MNLF’s Muslim base of support. Instead, the MNLF espoused an independent state – called the Bangsa Moro Republik – for all people of the southern Philippines, provided that they gave up their Philippine citizenship. The manifesto’s openness to non-Muslims and its emphasis on resistance to ‘the Philippine government’s colonial oppression’ attracted the attention of the New People’s Army (NPA), a Filipino Communist militant group. The NPA allegedly approached the MNLF about an alliance, but the MNLF rejected this offer in 1975. The group was cognizant of ideological differences with the NPA, as well as the need to retain the backing of its international Islamic supporters, which may be upset by an NPA-MNLF alliance. Though the MNLF never formally cooperated with the NPA, some critics of the MNLF would condemn the organization as communist and insufficiently Islamic throughout its lifetime. [15] Throughout the 1970s, women played an important role in supporting the MNLF. They provided communication between MNLF members in urban areas and those in rural areas. Women also delivered supplies, information, and weapons; made uniforms; prepared food; collected financial contributions; and helped with recruitment and raising awareness of the MNLF’s cause. Women also received weapons training from the MNLF. The MNLF also established a Women’s Committee and a women’s auxiliary group for the Bangsa Moro Army (BMA). [16] By the mid-1970s, the MNLF’s clear leading position within the Moro separatist movement and its successful use of guerrilla tactics against the state led the Philippine government to acknowledge the organization’s power. In January 1975, the Philippine government sent a negotiator to meet with the MNLF’s leadership. [17] In July 1975, in a second acknowledgment of the MNLF’s status, the MNLF was recognizes as a legitimate representative of the Moro separatist movement by the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), an international body of Muslim states and institutions that later became known as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. The OIC urged the Philippine government to reach a political settlement with the MNLF. [18] With Libya’s mediation, the MNLF and the Philippine government signed the Tripoli Agreement on December 23, 1976. This agreement would have established an autonomous region that included Basilan, Sulu, Palawan, and other areas in the southern Philippines. It also would have divided authority over the management of the region’s foreign policy, defense, education, courts, and finances between the Philippine government and the proposed autonomous government. [19] The MNLF wanted President Marcos to implement the agreement by executive order, but Marcos submitted the agreement to a referendum within the provinces that would comprise the new autonomous region. Filipino Muslims constituted the majority in only three of those provinces, and voters overwhelmingly rejected the agreement in the referendum on April 17, 1977. Only a few provinces approved the autonomy proposal; those provinces were located in two different regions, known today as Region IX and Region XII. Rather than creating a single autonomous region, the two provinces chose to establish two different autonomous regional governments, which would serve as the predecessors to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Thus, instead of creating a large and unified autonomous region led by the MNLF as was stipulated in the Tripoli Agreement, the referendum mostly maintained the status quo. [20] Unsatisfied with this result, the MNLF ended talks with the government. The group instead renewed its call for full independence and returned to guerrilla attacks. [21] In the same year, Hashim Salamat and other members broke from the organization to form the New MNLF, later called the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Salamat condemned Misuari’s dictatorial leadership and divergence from what he considered truly Islamic goals. According to Salamat, the MNLF did not focus enough on promoting an Islamic nation. Salamat believed that the organization’s strategy was largely dictated by Misuari’s autocratic personality rather than consultation with its members. Although Salamat had long been more religiously motivated than Misuari, Misuari’s decision to end government talks – a decision with which Salamat disagreed – exacerbated the leaders’ ideological differences and helped prompt the MILF’s split from the MNLF. [22] Other dissatisfied members also left the MNLF between 1978 and 1982, including MNLF Vice Chairman and co-founder Abul Khayr Alonto. These members often established their own groups, some of which are considered factions of the MNLF rather than independent organizations. One example is the Moro National Liberation Front-Reformist Group (MNLF-RG) founded by MNLF member Dimas Pundato, which later disbanded. MNLF factions often emerged along tribal lines; for example, MNLF members who supported Dimas Pundato were from the Maranao tribe. [23] The MNLF’s internal problems during the late 1970s and early 1980s were compounded by its military losses to Philippine government forces, which ultimately pushed the MNLF to shift its demands from full independence to regional autonomy. In 1986, Misuari met with then-President Corazon Aquino and agreed to a ceasefire and negotiations. However, in the end, peace talks failed. [24] Meanwhile, Moro politicians and the Philippine government had been working to change the autonomy arrangement in the southern Philippines. This effort culminated in 1989 when President Aquino signed Republic Act No. 6734. The act established the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), which evolved from the autonomous regions created after the 1976 Tripoli Agreement. The government held a referendum whereby provinces could vote to be included in the ARMM, and only four of thirteen provinces chose to join the new region. The MNLF was not consulted about Republic Act No. 6734 nor the ARMM, and it opposed both policies. [25] In the early 1990s, several MNLF members frustrated with the MNLF’s approach to improving Moros’ status broke off to form the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). The ASG presented itself as a more extreme version of its parent organization. It utilized violent tactics like bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations to gain attention and promote the Moro separatist cause. [26] During the administration of Fidel Ramos, who succeeded Aquino as president in 1992, the MNLF experienced a diplomatic breakthrough with the Philippine government. The MNLF and the government engaged in peace talks mediated by international actors, including the OIC, the Libyan government of Muammar el-Qaddafi, and the Indonesian government of Suharto. The Philippine government and the MNLF signed Statements of Understanding and Interim Agreements between 1992 and 1996. These efforts culminated in the Final Peace Agreement—also called the Jakarta Peace Agreement—that was signed by the Philippine government, the MNLF, and the OIC on September 2, 1996. The 1996 agreement officially ended the MNLF’s fight against the government. It designated a Special Zone of Peace and Development (SZOPAD) in the southern Philippines, which would be the focus of special development and investment efforts for three years, and it expanded the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The agreement outlined the ARMM’s new governance structures and called for the integration of MNLF members into the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). These stipulations would be implemented across two phases. [27] The MNLF at this time allied itself with President Ramos’ political party, Lakas (Strength). About a week after the Final Peace Agreement was signed, Misuari ran in the elections for the ARMM’s regional governorship. With the Philippine government’s support, Misuari easily won. [28] Despite its benefits for the MNLF’s external relations, the 1996 agreement triggered further divisions within the organization. Some MNLF members supported and participated in the ARMM government, the council overseeing the SZOPAD’s administration, and the Philippine security forces. However, others were angered by what they viewed as capitulation to the Philippine government. Dissatisfied members accused Misuari of sacrificing Moro welfare and independence for his own political gain. Many members left the MNLF altogether to join the MILF, which strongly denounced the agreement and advocated full Moro independence. The MILF attributed the enormous surge in its recruitment to backlash from the 1996 agreement, and its membership grew to approximately 15,000 militants. The MILF is generally considered to have replaced the MNLF as the dominant group within the Moro separatist movement at this time. [29] After 1996, the MNLF demobilized. The MNLF’s primary purpose and structure during this period are unclear, but it seemed to function almost as a form of political identification. Though the MNLF withdrew from the Moro separatist fight, networks between its members continued to exist. The 1996 agreement originally had provisions for including a certain number of MNLF members in the regional government, and approximately half of the MNLF’s fighters entered the PNP and the AFP. [30] The agreement also created special programs to provide education and technical skills for MNLF forces that did not integrate into the AFP or the PNP. MNLF militants with political ambitions utilized the group’s connections to President Lakas to run for elected office. [31] The MNLF did not disarm, although some MNLF members who integrated into Philippine society chose to surrender some of their weapons through a buy-back program called Balik-BARIL (Return Gun). [32] Despite its members’ successful integration into Philippine society and politics, the MNLF grew upset with the implementation of the 1996 agreement. Many MNLF members believed that the 2001 New Organic Act for the ARMM – which initiated the 1996 agreement’s second stage – contradicted the Final Peace Agreement’s stipulations of authority over mineral resources. The MNLF fractured into various new factions, including the Executive Council of 15 (EC-15) – established in 2001 – that emerged in opposition to a faction still loyal to and led by Misuari. Before ARMM elections in November 2001, Misuari’s dissatisfaction with the 1996 agreement’s implementation and his own waning influence drove him to lead an armed attack in Sulu and Zamboanga City. This attack – carried out by Misuari’s MNLF faction, sometimes called the Misuari Breakaway Group (MBG) – was meant to stop the ARMM elections that Misuari did not believe he would win. [33] Misuari escaped to Malaysia after the rebellion failed. However, he was arrested and deported back to the Philippines, where he was jailed. [34] Misuari was placed under house arrest in 2006. He was released in 2008 after prosecutors could not provide enough evidence to connect him to the 2001 rebellion in Sulu. [35] After Misuari’s fall, MNLF member Alvarez Isnaji served as acting ARMM governor. Fellow MNLF member Parouk S. Hussin won the second ARMM governorship, which ended in 2005. [36] In the same year, Misuari’s followers within the MNLF launched attacks in Sulu in February and November, allegedly cooperating with the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). Misuari’s well-armed MNLF faction was able to engage the Philippine military in conventional warfare, conducting direct attacks against army positions. The conflicts in 2005 displaced over 80,000 people from the areas of intense fighting, mostly through a preemptive evacuation of approximately 70,000 civilians and MNLF supporters. [37] In 2006, the MNLF and the Philippine government attempted to renew their relationship and work together to implement the 1996 peace agreement, introducing the Sulu Road Map for Peace and Development which highlighted several development priorities. [38] The MNLF also began fighting against the ASG, in conjunction with the Armed Forces of the Philippines, after the ASG’s designation as a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. [39] However, the cooperation and goodwill between the MNLF and the Philippine government waned due to continued difficulties with implementation of the peace agreement. [40] Beginning especially in the late 2000s, the MNLF-Philippine government relationship was complicated further by government negotiations with the MILF. Many MNLF members opposed MILF-Philippine negotiations on the grounds that their own 1996 Final Peace Agreement had already ended the question regarding the status of Muslims in the Philippines. [41] Under President Benigno Aquino III, who assumed office in 2010, talks with the MILF advanced significantly. These talks centered on replacing the ARMM with a new autonomous region called the Bangsamoro. On October 12, 2012, the MILF and the Philippine government signed the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) to establish this new independent region. [42] Since the beginning of talks between the government and the MILF, Misuari and his MNLF followers have been among the strongest opponents of negotiations with the MILF and the proposed Bangsamoro region. On August 12, 2013, Misuari unilaterally declared the independence of the Bangsamoro Republik at a gathering in Sulu. [43] In September, MNLF fighters engaged Philippine government forces in Zamboanga City and took hundreds of hostages. Government forces were deployed to the city. The mayor instituted a curfew, and travel to the area was restricted because of the standoff. The hostage crisis in Zamboanga City lasted approximately three weeks. [44] Although an arrest warrant was issued for Misuari, he allegedly managed to flee the country for some time. From 2013 until talks over the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) in 2018, Misuari was believed to be back in the southern Philippines guarded by his followers. [45] During the 2013 hostage crisis in Zamboanga City, an MNLF faction led by Muslimin Sema condemned the violence and refused to participate. [46] Because of the attack, the MNLF Central Committee allegedly ousted Misuari in absentia on February 10, 2014, a move supported by the OIC. The MNLF Central Committee then elected Abul Khayr Alonto as chairman. [47] MILF-Philippine government talks on the proposed Bangsamoro progressed, particularly in 2015 with the introduction into the Philippine Congress of the Basic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (BLBAR), another name for the BBL. There was continual disagreement among the MNLF factions on how to react to improving government-MILF cooperation. Some leaders within the MNLF – including Misuari and Habib Mujahab Hashim, chair of an MNLF faction called the MNLF-Islamic Command Council (MNLF-ICC) – spoke out against the peace process. Misuari originally boycotted talks in support of the original 1976 agreement forming the ARMM. [48] Other MNLF leaders – such as Sema and Abul Khayr Alonto – urged support for the proposed Bangsamoro. Though the MILF-Philippine government negotiations largely excluded the MNLF, various MNLF members appeared before the Philippine Congress in order to express their opposition or support. [49] On July 24, 2018, the Philippine House of Representatives passed the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), the final name of the former BBL. [50] A Muslim regional entity was created in Mindanao, and MILF representatives at the signing of the bill declared their support. MILF leader Ebrahim declared that 30,000-40,000 fighters would be decommissioned. [51] Misuari and Hashim’s factions of the MNLF remained opposed to the BOL. Instead, they pushed the government to honor the 1996 ARMM agreement and place Misuari in the position of governor of the autonomous region. [52] In March 2019 during a meeting with President Duterte, Misauri allegedly threatened to go to war with the government if the Moros were not given their own form of federal system and advocated for the formation of a panel where the MNLF could negotiate with the Duterte government.

Leadership, Name Changes, Size Estimates, Resources, Geographic Locations Leadership Name Changes Size Estimates Resources Geographic Locations However, the group has factionalized and weakened over time, especially after the 1996 agreement. Today, the MNLF consists of various factions headed by different leaders. These leaders sometimes cooperate with each other and sometimes express antithetical opinions and goals, especially regarding the MILF-Philippine government talks and the proposed Bangsamoro region. There are conflicting reports on who serves as the MNLF’s chairman. The Philippine government, the OIC, separate MNLF factions, and the media name multiple individuals as the organization’s chairman. [1] Nur Misuari (1972 to Present) : Misuari is the MNLF’s founding chairman and, as of 2019, leads one of the organization’s current factions. [2] During his term as ARMM governor from 1996 to 2001, Misuari was heavily criticized by government officials and MNLF members for political and financial mismanagement. These disagreements led to the formation of anti-Misuari factions like Muslimin Sema’s Executive Council of 15 (EC-15). [3] After the 2013 Zamboanga City Crisis and warrant for his arrest, Misuari went into hiding. However, he continued to hold an influential position among some of the factions, three of which chose him in 2014 as their representative for any future talks with the government. Misuari strongly opposed MILF-Philippine government talks. [4] In the lead-up to the passage of the BBL, however, Misuari met with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and took a more public role. He opposed the elimination of the ARMM as a framework for Moro autonomy in the country’s south and insisted that he be made governor of the autonomous region. [5] Dimas Pundato (1982 to 1985): Pundato established an MNLF faction called the Moro National Liberation Front-Reformist Group (MNLF-RG) in 1982, after Misuari refused to enact his reform proposals. While the MNLF under Misuari demanded independence, Pundato and his MNLF-RG supporters demanded autonomy instead. Supported by Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, Pundato ultimately wanted to create a Shariah-based society in the southern Philippines. The MNLF-RG was headquartered in Malaysia and seems to have been short-lived, although there is little information on the group or its founder. [6] Muslimin Sema (2001 to Present): Sema served as the MNLF’s secretary general before he left the group to over dissatisfaction with Misuari’s policies. Sema led an anti-Misuari faction called the Executive Council of 15 (EC-15), which was established by fifteen dissatisfied MNLF members in 2001. The EC-15 emerged as an MNLF faction rather than an independent group. For an unknown period of time, the Philippine government formally recognized the EC-15 – sometimes called the Council of 15 or the Central Committee – as the official leadership of the MNLF. Later, Sema served as the mayor of Cotabato City from 2010-2013. [7] In 2017, Sema stepped down as the chairman of the EC-15. [8] Hatimil Hassan (2001 to Present): Hassan was a leading figure within the Executive Council of 15 (EC-15), an anti-Misuari faction of the MNLF. Although he was sometimes identified as the EC-15’s main leader, he was generally considered only its nominal leader, as real power reportedly resided with Muslimin Sema. Following Sema’s departure as chair of the EC-15 in 2017, it is unclear if Hassan has taken on more of a leadership role in the faction. Before helping form the EC-15, Hassan previously served as the MNLF’s vice chairman. [9] In March of 2019, Hassan was elected as the deputy speaker of the Bangsamoro Parliament. [10] Abul Khayr Alonto (2014 to Present): Alonto was generally recognized as the MNLF’s official chairman after the Misuari faction’s attack in Zamboanga City in 2013. The MNLF Central Committee allegedly ousted Misuari on February 10, 2014, a move supported by the OIC, and elected Alonto as chairman. [11] Alonto previously served as the MNLF’s first vice chairman before leaving the organization for a time in 1978 because of opposition to Misuari’s policies. [12] In 2016, Alonto was named Chair and Secretary of the Mindanao Development Authority, a position he still held as of 2019. [13] Habib Mujahab Hashim (Unknown to Present): Hashim currently leads the MNLF’s Islamic Command Council (MNLF-ICC), which emerged as a faction of the MNLF in the late 1980s. [14] Hashim was the MNLF’s head negotiator with the government between 1986 and 1987. In the early 2000s, he served in government offices dealing with Moro affairs. Hashim has strongly opposed MILF-Philippine government peace talks and instead insisted on the proper implementation of the 1996 agreement. [15] As of 2019, further activity by Hashim is unknown, but he likely still leads the MNLF-ICC. His last activity as chair of the group was in 2018. [16] Hadja Bainon Karon (Unknown to Present): Karon is the long-time chair of the MNLF’s Women’s Committee. She also served as the ARMM’s acting vice governor in the late 2000s or early 2010s. Karon has expressed support for the MILF-Philippine government peace negotiations. [17] As of 2019, she is currently a member of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) and a chair of the Regional Commission on Bangsamoro Women (RCWB). [18] Alvarez Isnaji (Unknown to Unknown): Around the 1990s or early 2000s, Isnaji established the Isnaji Group, a faction within the MNLF. There is little information regarding this group, which may have been disbanded in 2001. Previously, Isnaji held a high-ranking military position in the MNLF. In 2008, he was arrested for his alleged role in a kidnapping while serving as mayor of Indanan. [19] As of 2019, further activity by Isnaji is unknown.

From its beginnings in the 1970s, the MNLF received significant financial support from foreign actors that backed the Moro separatist struggle, including Libya, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Foreign Islamic government agencies, foundations, charities, and businesses also contributed funds to the MNLF. Within the Philippines, the MNLF depended on zakat, or alms, that included money and food. [1] Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MNLF acquired its weapons from corrupt government officers, the black market, looting after battles, and Libyan shipments. Many MNLF members also relied on their own weapons. The MNLF’s arms have included assault rifles, machine guns, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. The MNLF has also reportedly used landmines in the past, specifically against the Armed Forces of the Philippines. [2] After the 1996 Final Peace Agreement, the MNLF received funding and support from the Philippine government because of its role in leading the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Additionally, some MNLF members who integrated into Philippine society chose to surrender some of their weapons through a buy-back program called Balik-BARIL (Return Gun). However, the Balik-BARIL program was generally unsuccessful in reducing the MNLF’s stockpile, receiving only 4,874 firearms of mostly low quality. [3] There is little information on the MNLF’s current resources, especially since many members integrated into Philippine society after 1996. Additionally, because the MNLF has fractured into several different factions, it is difficult to estimate total resource levels or fundraising and weapons acquisition activities.

Ideology, Aims, Political Activities, Targets, and Tactics Ideology and Goals Political Activities Targets and Tactics The MNLF uses nationalist rhetoric to call for an independent state in the Southern Philippines. Its 1974 manifesto discusses the Moro people as a nation based more on a shared homeland in the southern Philippines and oppressed by the central government, rather than a group characterized by a common religion. While the group has not emphasized an Islamic agenda, the MNLF claims to represent Filipino Muslims. It made a few references in its manifesto to defending Islam and has historically sought Islamic supporters like the OIC. It enjoys the OIC’s official recognition. [1] The MNLF initially sought a fully independent state for the Moros, but its leadership accepted an autonomy arrangement in the 1996 Final Peace Agreement. [2] Currently, the MNLF is divided in its aims. Some factions – led by Sema and Alonto – have supported the MILF-Philippine agreement and the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), while other factions – led by Misuari and Hashim – have voiced opposition and insisted upon full implementation of the 1996 agreement.

Beginning in the mid-1970s and continuing on and off for two decades, the MNLF engaged in peace talks with the Philippine government, then led by President Ferdinand Marcos. The OIC and Libya facilitated these talks, with the former urging the Philippine government to negotiate and the latter hosting the negotiations that culminated in the 1976 Tripoli Agreement. [1] The next significant round of talks began in 1992, when Philippine President Fidel Ramos restarted peace negotiations with the MNLF. As before, various international actors mediated the talks, including the OIC, the Libyan government of Muammar el-Qaddafi, and the Indonesian government of Suharto. The Philippine government and the MNLF signed Statements of Understanding and Interim Agreements between 1992 and 1996. These negotiation efforts culminated in the Final Peace Agreement – also called the Jakarta Peace Agreement – that was signed by the Philippine government, the MNLF, and the OIC on September 2, 1996. The 1996 agreement officially ended the MNLF’s fight against the government. It designated a Special Zone of Peace and Development (SZOPAD) in the southern Philippines, which would be the focus of special development and investment efforts for three years. The agreement also expanded the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and outlined its new governance structures. In addition to these territorial provisions, the agreement called for the integration of MNLF members into the Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines. These stipulations were to be implemented across two phases. [2] The 1996 agreement drove the MNLF to become more integrated with the Philippine political system. The MNLF officially allied itself with Lakas (Strength), the political party of then-President Ramos. Drawing on these political connections, MNLF leader Misuari easily won election as the ARMM’s regional governor about a week after the 1996 agreement’s signing. The political alliance also enabled other MNLF members to run for elected office. [3] Some MNLF members entered the ARMM government or the council overseeing the SZOPAD’s administration. [4] MNLF members held the ARMM governorship from 1996 to 2005. [5] In March of 2019, MNLF leader Hatimil Hassan was elected as the deputy speaker of the Bangsamoro Parliament. [6] The MILF-Philippine government peace talks, culminating with the signing of the BOL in July 2018, largely excluded the MNLF. Many MNLF members have opposed the ongoing MILF-Philippine government peace talks, insisting that the 1996 Final Peace Agreement already resolved the question of the status of Muslims in the Philippines. MNLF leaders, including Habib Mujahab Hashim and Muslimin Sema, have spoken in front of the Philippine Congress to express their support for or opposition to the proposed Bangsamoro region.

The MNLF has historically depended on armed struggle and government negotiations to achieve its aim of an independent state or autonomous region for Filipino Muslims. Throughout the 1970s, the MNLF fought the Philippine government and armed Christian groups. The MNLF’s militant activity began with attacks against government targets in Marawi City after then-President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in September 1972. Although the MNLF had some capacity to engage in conventional warfare, a massive military operation launched by the Armed Forces of the Philippines in 1973 forced the group to turn to guerrilla tactics with support from Libya and Malaysia. [1] MNLF negotiations with the government began in the mid-1970s and continued for two decades, interspersed with violence. The MNLF often renewed its attacks against the government when it was dissatisfied with the results or implementation of peace agreements. For example, such violence occurred after the 1977 referendum on autonomy in the southern Philippines. The MNLF’s attacks have mostly involved firefights with government troops. The MNLF conducted scattered kidnappings, boat and airplane hijackings, and attacks on civilians in the 1970s. [2] However, the group has generally focused on targeting government troops rather than civilians. The MNLF has used both guerrilla tactics and conventional warfare effectively. [3] The 1996 Final Peace Agreement formally ended the MNLF’s armed struggle but did not completely cease the MNLF’s use of violence. Most notably, Misuari led his faction in two significant violent campaigns in 2001 and 2013. In 2001, Misuari’s followers launched a major attack against government troops. In the 2013 attack, MNLF members entered Zamboanga City, took hostages, and fought government forces. Violent activity by other MNLF factions (i.e., those factions not led by Misuari) has been less prominent.

In particular, there is little information on specific attacks and battles between 1977 and 2001. Although the MNLF and the Philippine government were engaged in sporadic peace talks, the group continued to mount attacks and use violence to achieve its goals. October 21, 1972 : MNLF operatives launched an attack on various targets in Marawi City, including the Philippine Constabulary, a government radio station, and a state university. This attack was conducted in response to then-President Ferdinand Marcos’ declaration of martial law. It is generally considered the beginning of the MNLF’s armed uprising against the Philippine state (unknown killed, unknown wounded). [1] February 7, 1974 : The MNLF entered Jolo, the capital of Sulu, and reportedly tried to declare Mindanao’s independence for the first time. The group allegedly attacked Jolo and held it for days before the Philippine military retook the city. The Battle of Jolo devastated the city, although reports differ over whether the MNLF or government forces were mostly responsible for the destruction (unknown killed, unknown wounded). [2] October 10, 1977 : A MNLF commander invited a Philippine military general to a market in Patikul under the pretense of a ceasefire meeting. MNLF forces then ambushed the general and his men (34 killed, unknown wounded). [3] November 19, 2001 : Misuari’s followers attacked multiple Philippine military camps on the island of Jolo, allegedly to undermine ARMM elections in which Misuari was expected to lose. (111+ killed, unknown wounded). [4] September 9, 2013 : Forces from Nur Misuari’s MNLF faction entered Zamboanga City, attacking government forces and ultimately taking about 300 civilian hostages.

In 1975, the Philippine government began negotiating with the MNLF for the first time. However, the MNLF grew less popular due to the 1996 Final Peace Agreement and the growing perception that Nur Misuari was committed more to his own political gain rather than to championing Moro welfare. With the MNLF’s decline, the MILF became the leading organization seeking Moro independence or autonomy. The almost decade-long MILF-Philippine government negotiations have further marginalized the MNLF. [1] Historically, the MNLF’s strongest support has come from Muslim tribes based in western Mindanao, namely the Tausug, Sama, and Yakan. The MNLF has also enjoyed substantial support from the Maguindanao and Maranao tribes based in central Mindanao. [2] The fracturing of the MNLF along tribal lines, however, has eroded its support base.

The MNLF and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) – the most significant splinter group to break away from the MNLF – have historically competed for resources, support, and political legitimacy since the MILF splintered in 1977. The MILF’s rise within the Moro separatist movement coincided with the MNLF’s decline, following the MNLF’s 1996 Final Peace Agreement with the Philippine government, which the MILF strongly opposed. [1] In recent years, the MNLF’s factions have adopted different attitudes toward the MILF. Sema’s Executive Council of 15 (EC-15) supported the MILF-Philippine government peace talks and maintained friendly relations with the MILF. In contrast, Misuari and his faction have resented the MILF and sought to undermine the negotiation process. [2] The MNLF has formally condemned the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), which is listed by the United States and the United Nations as a terrorist organization. The MNLF has cooperated with the Philippine military to oppose the ASG. However, at the local level, relationships between MNLF and ASG commanders have sometimes resulted in alliances against the Philippine military.

Even before its formal establishment, the MNLF benefited from the influence of foreign actors, especially Malaysia. Beginning in 1969, the Malaysian government supplied training and weapons to Filipino Muslims, some of whom would later become MNLF members. MNLF leader Nur Misuari was one of those Malaysian-trained members. The group’s connections to Malaysia are also apparent in the fact that the MNLF was officially formed on the Malaysian island of Pulau Pangkor in 1972. [1] After its establishment, the MNLF also secured financial support and military training from Libya, the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), and other foreign sources. [2] From 1972 to 1975, Libya and the OIC provided approximately $35 million to the MNLF, including arms and equipment that were funneled to the group through Malaysia. In the mid-1970s, Libya became the major training site for MNLF members. Syria, Pakistan, and the Palestine Liberation Organization also trained MNLF members beginning in the 1980s. [3] In 1975, The OIC officially recognized the MNLF as the representative of Filipino Muslims, and the MNLF has continued to trumpet its status as an OIC non-state observer to emphasize its legitimacy. [4] Until the 1996 Final Peace Agreement, the OIC annually supplied $1 million to the MNLF. [5] The OIC also played a pivotal role in the MNLF-Philippine government negotiations leading up to the 1996 Final Peace Agreement, and it was a signatory to the official document. [6] More recently, the OIC has also supported the MILF in its negotiations with the Philippine government. The MILF-Philippine government talks, and eventual signing of the BOL, marginalized the MNLF. The OIC has advocated a peace process open to all stakeholders including the MNLF, which it still formally recognizes.

https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/01/27/1888489/plebiscite-mindanao-will-it-be-last,"COTABATO CITY, Philippines — Mindanao had four plebiscites related to the Moro issue in about 40 years and stakeholders to the southern peace process can only hope the one held last Jan. 21 would be the last. The plebiscite for the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) was not the first since Malacañang started addressing the Moro secessionist rebellion in 1970s. The first plebiscite for Moro autonomy was administered during the time of the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos after the signing of the Tripoli Agreement on Dec. 23, 1976. Then Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi brokered the Tripoli Agreement between the Philippine government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). One of the objectives of the agreement was to group together nine southern cities and 13 provinces into a Moro-led autonomous self-governing geographical entity. Among those who crafted the Tripoli Agreement on government’s behalf were former Maguindanao congressman Simeon Datumanong and Meranao Lininding Pangandaman, then ambassador to Saudi Arabia, who was to serve as governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) from 1993 to 1996. That plebiscite resulted in the creation of the Regional Autonomous Governments in Regions 9 and 12. There was another plebiscite in 1989 for the ratification of the first charter of ARMM, under Republic Act 6734, that fused together Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi as ARMM’s component-provinces. Zacaria Candao, who was counsel of MNLF founder Nur Misuari during the crafting of the Tripoli Agreement, became the first elected ARMM regional governor, serving from 1990 to 1993. RA 6734 was amended via another plebiscite in late 2001 to become RA 9054 that resulted in the inclusion of Basilan and Marawi City into ARMM’s core territory. The plebiscite for the ratification of the BOL under RA 11054 on Jan. 21 was the fourth since the 1970s. The government’s diplomatic dealings with southern secessionists began with talks with the MNLF in 1972 that ended with the signing of the final truce on Sept. 2, 1996 that as consequence, catapulted Misuari to the helm of the ARMM government. Misuari was elected ARMM governor three days after he and the administration of then president Fidel Ramos forged the final peace deal. The peace overture between the national government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) that splintered from the MNLF in the early 1980s started Jan. 7, 1997, barely three months after Misuari and the Ramos administration forged the peace pact. The MILF was founded by Ustadz Salamat Hashim, a graduate of Islamic theology at the Al-Azzhar University in Cairo, Egypt. He and Misuari co-founded the MNLF but parted ways over revolutionary and religious ideals. Hashim established the MILF in the early 1980s. He died of cardiovascular ailment in Butig town in Lanao del Sur in 2003. Hashim’s chairmanship of the MILF’s central committee was taken over by Hadji Murad Ebrahim, then figurehead of the front’s Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces. The government-MILF peace talks began on Jan. 7, 1997 and ended with the crafting on March 27, 2014 of the Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro (CAB). The government-MILF peace process spanned four presidents – Ramos, Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Benigno Aquino III. The government and the MILF first had in July 2008 the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain (MOA-AD) that the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional several weeks later. The BOL, ratified by the Jan. 21 plebiscite, was premised on two accords between the government and the MILF – the 2012 Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro and the CAB in 2014. Talks between the Aquino administration and the MILF reached a Bangsamoro Basic Law, or BBL, that was shelved after the Mamasapano incident in January 2015. After the election of President Duterte in 2016, Malacañang and the MILF revised the BBL through the Bangsamoro Transition Commission, comprised of representatives from the rebel group and the national government. Duterte shepherded the new BBL through the House of Representatives with the help of lawmakers in ARMM, among them Maguindanao’s two congressional representatives, Sandra Sema and Sajid Mangudadatu, Anak Mindanao party-list Rep. Amihilda Sangcopan and Tawi-Tawi Rep. Ruby Sahali. The new BBL, now the BOL or RA 11054, was approved by the bicameral committee of Congress in July 2018. By operation of law, the BOL will now replace the 29-year-old ARMM with an expanded Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) led by the MILF. Plebiscite in Mindanao: Will it be the last? John Unson (The Philippine Star) - January 27, 2019 - 12:00am"
https://opinion.inquirer.net/120350/stripped-naked-by-history,"It’s taken over half a century since that infamous massacre of Jabidah, 23 young Muslim soldiers in Marcos’ clandestine attack force on Sabah, to arrive at this new moment in Mindanao. After centuries of war provoked from within and without, that powder keg exploded in 1968 in a new Moro generation’s war against “Imperial Manila.” But their Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) turned into a reality check for both sides, however — a Philippines dependent on the oil fields of the MNLF’s Middle East allies and a brave but far outnumbered young Moro army warring for self-rule. ADVERTISEMENTThe “autonomy” the powers-that-be eventually dangled revealed the MNLF’s internal contradictions. Pressured by their main sponsor, Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi, MNLF Chair Nur Misuari signed the Tripoli Agreement in 1976 without consulting Commander Hashim Salamat. Salamat led the split that founded the rival Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), with 57 other battle-hardened field commanders leaning to independence. Today, the MILF is government’s partner under the new Bangsamoro Organic Law that aspires to a new Bangsamoro. First named by Misuari’s fiery generation, Bangsamoro today means a new patchwork of Muslim, Christian and indigenous communities taking steps to live together in peace, closer to Mindanao’s present-day reality with generations of Christian migrants. Two major changes in the MNLF’s original concept of Bangsamoro introduced by the MILF are a measure of Mindanao’s historical evolution. First, the MILF decided to remain part of the Philippine Republic as a sub-state. Second is the primacy of basic Islamic precepts, not political ideology, in its internal affairs. Together, they raise hopes for Mindanao’s full development in its unique culture and character. With naysayers attempting to derail this new process by bombing plebiscite polling places and even the Jolo Cathedral, a striking new element is the loud protest of Moro women against the centuries-old pattern of continued war to settle differences. One voice belongs to Ayesha Merdeka Concon, 24, historian daughter of MNLF founding member and vice chair Abul Khayr Alonto. Her father went to war from a heady mix of historical grievance and Marxist ideology. Ayesha now bears witness to her father coming down from the hills to tell a Misuari pussyfooting from implementing the Tripoli Agreement that he, Abul Khayr, would lead the implementation “if only to give our people reprieve from the horrors of this war.” Four decades have since stripped things down to essence in Mindanao. Misuari is now known as a failed ARMM governor. Abul Khayr Alonto is Mindanao Development Authority chair. The faith-oriented MILF is holding at bay territorial splinter groups like the kidnap-for-ransom Abu Sayyaf and other extremist Islamic groups influenced by the Jemaah Islamiyah.

The impending national elections and the stalled peace talks in the southern Philippines dominated dinner conversation. Discussing the leading candidate for the presidency, one unimpressed rebel leader said the peace talks were “too complicated for Senator Aquino to understand“. Four years into his presidency, Aquino is set to oversee the signing of a final peace agreement with the MILF, the country’s largest Muslim rebel group. Supporters hope the deal creating the autonomous Bangsamoro region will bring an end to 40 years of armed conflict in Mindanao that has killed at least 120,000 people and displaced more than two million. It is expected to be signed this Thursday, March 27. But now comes the real test: implementing the deal. Threats from armed splinter groups remain, and Aquino still faces doubts over his ability to deliver what he had promised against the backdrop of lingering distrust between Christians and the Muslim minority. Since the 1970s, Philippine leaders – including Aquino’s mother Corazon Aquino, president from 1986 to 1992 – have tried and failed to end the violence in the south. “We all know that this process will be very challenging,” Miriam Ferrer, the government’s top negotiator, told Al Jazeera. “President Aquino is very committed to use his political capital for the effective implementation of everything that has been signed.” Ferrer said Aquino understands that only a “meaningful autonomy” for the Philippines’ estimated 10.3 million Muslims can bring peace in the restive southern islands, and drive economic growth in a region long considered to be the poorest in the country. With an approval rating above 70 percent in December 2013 and presiding over an economy that has grown by an average of 6.3 percent per year during his time in office, Aquino has expendable political capital. He is serving a single six-year term as president, so he does not have to worry about re-election. And his party controls both chambers of congress, which is expected to ratify the agreement. The fact of the matter is that the Christian community does not want to be part of a Muslim-dominated region. -Steven Rood, Asia Foundation In exchange for the creation of the Bangsamoro (from the words bansa , or nation; and Moro, or Muslim) and a government with its own budget and police powers, the MILF has given up its violent struggle for an independent state, promising to turn in the weapons of the more than 15,000 rebel fighters . Steven Rood, Asia Foundation’s representative in the Philippines and an adviser to the peace talks, credited MILF Chairman Al-Hajj Murad Ebrahim for being “realistic” during the negotiations, accepting a territory smaller than what was claimed in the 1973 agreement in Tripoli, Libya. That original deal covered areas dominated by Christians, triggering years of bloody conflict. “While there might be some dreams of sufficient agreement and relations between the communities, the fact of the matter is that the Christian community does not want to be part of a Muslim-dominated region,” Rood told Al Jazeera. “They don’t mind having a Muslim-dominated region next door, if it is a peaceful one. But even if it is peaceful, they don’t want to be part of it.” Still, Aquino pressed on with the agreement, seeing an opportunity to talk to the Muslim rebels following his victory in 2010. A year after his election, Aquino held a secret meeting with rebel leader Ebrahim, in Tokyo, Japan – an encounter roundly criticised as “ill-advised” by allies of the president, and called “an act of treason” by an unnamed Philippine diplomat. The high-stakes meeting proved to be the breakthrough in the floundering talks, establishing “trust” between the Philippine government and the rebels, said Kristian Herbolzheimer, of the London-based Conciliation Resources. “That was very important when the two leaders met face-to-face in Japan,” he said. “I think that gave very strong signals from the president to his constituency that the government is serious about this, which is why he would meet the chairman of the MILF.” Herbolzheimer, a member of a team of international observers, told Al Jazeera that the agreement is the most significant such deal in the world since the 2006 peace accord between the government of Nepal and Maoist rebels. ‘Factionalisation’ in Mindanao But not everyone is in favour of the deal. Julkipli Wadi, dean of Islamic studies at the University of the Philippines, said other Muslim rebel groups such as the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) of Nur Misuari have been excluded from the talks. Despite its peace agreement with the MILF, the Philippines continues to fight armed splinter groups like the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters and the Abu Sayyaf [Ted Regencia/Al Jazeera] He also pointed to the “factionalisation” of different rebel groups in Mindanao. He said that while the MILF negotiated with the government, some of its members who favoured an armed struggle for independence left and formed the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), which have been involved in bloody skirmishes with the Philippine military in recent months. Wadi also said that government negotiators relied heavily on the mediation of Malaysia, which is involved in a separate border dispute with the Philippines on Sabah island. “The two instances of the Sabah siege, the war in Malaysia months ago, and the war in Zamboanga would show that there is something wrong with the peace process,” Wadi said. That three-week standoff in Zamboanga City, which killed almost 200 people and displaced 100,000 civilians , was blamed on the MNLF – the Philippines’ original Muslim rebel group, which signed a similar peace agreement with the government in 1996. That deal fell through during its implementation and its leader Misuari has gone into hiding, refusing the overtures of the now more powerful MILF to be part of the new peace agreement. The Abu Sayyaf Group, which is involved in kidnappings in the south and considered a terrorist group by the Philippine government, is also excluded from the deal. ‘The devil is in the details’ The government insists the current peace deal is different, allowing for broader representation from different forces within the region – such as women, youth and indigenous people. The new Bangsamoro government will also receive 75 percent of taxes collected in the region, 75 percent of revenues from metallic minerals and some control of fishing territories. According to stastics, the region covered by the future Bangsamoro autonomous region, 48.7 percent of the population lives on less than $2 a day [Ted Regencia/Al Jazeera] Ferrer, the government negotiator, said checks and balances are also in place to ensure accountability and prevent corruption, one of the main problems that eventually led to the breakdown of the 1996 agreement. “I think a significant difference between the last 10 years and the current period is that a lot of new civil society organisations have been formed to ensure that the governance institutions should not fail in their task,” she said. Amid the “euphoria” of the impending agreement, Rood, a long-time scholar on Mindanao, warned against false expectations of the peace process. “Remember that this is a long process, and we are in it for a long haul,” he said. “Nobody underestimates the difficulty of this.” As President Aquino himself acknowledged in a speech promoting the agreement: “The devil is in the details.”"
https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-muslim-rebels-try-to-salvage-peace-pact/2698026.html,"MANILA - One year ago, the Philippine government reached an agreement with a Muslim rebel group that was meant to put an end to more than four decades of conflict that had left about 120,000 people dead and displaced millions. But the peace process is facing a major setback after a botched military operation to bring in internationally suspected terrorists in parts of the Muslim-majority south in January resulted in a bloody gunbattle between government forces and Moro Islamic Liberation Front fighters. Dozens were killed in the fighting, including 44 police commandos, 17 MILF rebels and three civilians. It happened just as lawmakers were starting deliberations on a proposed law that would create an autonomous region in the south. The incident has raised doubt about the peace pact on both sides that has been difficult to quell. Lawmakers in Manila are questioning the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law , saying some parts are unconstitutional, while some factions in the south want to scrap the deal altogether and return to conflict. Once 'misinformation dissipates' Miriam Coronel-Ferrer, the government’s chief peace negotiator, said, ""Once the fog of all of this misinformation dissipates, through some of the corrective measures and the confidence-building measures that we are undertaking now, we are assuming that both the House and the Senate will be able to resume their deliberations next month.” Ferrer said one of those corrective measures is the newly formed citizens’ council to shepherd the bill. She said the group will be crucial to moving the peace process forward. In a national address Friday President Benigno Aquino named the leaders of the council including Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Tagle, Philippine businessman Jaime Zobel de Ayala and retired Supreme Court Chief Justice Hilario Davide. While the Aquino administration tries to get the peace deal back on track, the military continues to pursue a breakaway Muslim rebel faction in the heart of the MILF’s area. The U.N. High Commission on Refugees said more than 120,000 people have been displaced because of the operation. The Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters do not agree with the peace deal and broke away from the MILF in 2011. They have been fighting the government ever since and officials believe they are harboring nine suspected terrorists, including foreign nationals. Military spokesman Harold Cabunoc said apart from going after the rebel faction, the operation is intended to highlight the Moro Islamic Liberation Front’s openness to pursuing peace. “We challenge them to show sincerity by helping us, by sharing information about the BIFF, to insure that the presence of the BIFF is not tolerated inside the MILF communities,"" Cabunoc said. He added that MILF has been complying with the military. Peace negotiators want the Bangsamoro measure signed into law before the second half of the year so residents in the affected region can decide whether to be part of the new entity. Once the area is determined, residents will vote in May 2016 for members of the newly created parliament that would see a Bangsamoro government in place by the time President Aquino steps down a month later."
http://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1742513/Zamboanga/Local-News/Sulu-Sultanate-Bangsa-Sug-push-revision-of-Bangsamoro-Basic-Law,"THE Sultanate of Sulu and the multi-sectoral groups of the Bangsa Sug has agreed in a consensus on Wednesday to push for the revision of certain provisions on the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL). The Bangsa Sug refers to the inhabitants of the provinces of Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi as well as certain areas in Zamboanga Peninsula. The consensus, which was held at a local hotel on Wednesday afternoon, May 9, was initiated by Datu Shahbandar Abdusakur Tan, the special envoy of the Royal Council of the Sulu Sultanate. The consensus was attended by more than 2,000 people coming from the different sectors of the Bangsa Sug, the religious leaders, academe, youth, women, and business. Tan said one of the provisions in the proposed BBL they wanted to be revised is Section 2 of Article III which states “the present geographical area of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM)” as automatic parts of the “Core Territory” of the Bangsamoro. Tan said each of the provinces in the present set up of ARMM should be given the right to freely choose whether they will join the new Bangsamoro region or not. “It’s not actually opt-out or opt-in. We just want a choice, let the people choose whether to opt-in or opt-out of the (new) Bangsamoro Region,” he explained. This (revision) is not actually against the Bangsamoro, it’s just that we want certain provisions on the proposed BBL to be modified to give our people the freedom of choice,” he added. Part of the position paper of the Bangsa Sug stated that the present proposal of the bill takes for granted that all the five constituent provinces of ARMM favor inclusion in the new Bangsamoro entity. “This should never be presumed because such presumption destroys the democratic essence of plebiscite. Precisely for the reason that the Bangsamoro entity is new, and is not just an amended version of the ARMM, the consent and/or option of the ARMM constituent provinces should be respected.” “When the constituent provinces voted for inclusion to the ARMM in past plebiscites, they consented to be included in the ARMM, and not in the Bangsamoro, which is a completely new legal entity. Ratification therefore should be on the basis of the majority votes of each constituent province, and not of the entire geographical area of the present ARMM.” The other provision they wish to be revised in Section 5 of Article III of the proposed BBL is the renaming of the Sulu Sea to Bangsamoro Waters. Tan said the Sulu Sea has been historically recognized due to the prominence of the Sulu Sultanate from the 15th to the 20th centuries. He said they will submit the position paper about their concerns to the legislators and other concerned authorities as well as the President. May 10, 2018"
https://www.manilatimes.net/sulu-cities-of-isabela-cotabato-to-reject-bol/499160/,"ZAMBOANGA CITY: With the Bangsamoro plebiscite set on Monday, Muslims in Sulu province, Isabela City in Basilan and Cotabato City in Maguindanao have vowed to reject the organic law, which the rebel group Moro Islamic Liberation Front or MILF is strongly pushing. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte is welcomed by Moro Islamic Liberation Front Chairman Al-Hajj Murad Ebrahim upon his arrival at the Shariff Kabunsuan Cultural Complex in Cotabato City on his way to attend the Peace Assembly for the Ratification of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) on January 18, 2019. Also in the photo are Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and Former Special Assistant to the President Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go. MALACANANG PHOTO The MILF, which signed an interim peace deal with Manila in 2014, is expected to rule the new Bangsamoro Autonomous Region should Muslims vote in favor of the Bangsamoro Organic Law or
BOL (Republic Act 11054), which shall replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao or ARMM. The ARMM is composed of Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Maguindanao, Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur provinces. A second referendum has been set for February 6 with several towns in North Cotabato and Lanao del Norte being included in the proposed Bangsamoro region. Majority of Sulu’s over 830,000 Tausug population led by Gov. Abdusakur “Toto” Tan and his father, Dr. Sakur Tan, wanted out of the autonomous region and be a part again of Zamboanga Peninsula or Region 9. Sulu, along with Basilan and Tawi-Tawi, were originally part of Region 9 with the signing of the 1986 peace agreement between the Moro National Liberation Front under Nur Misuari and the Ramos administration. After the accord, a referendum was held on the heels of the 1989 signing by then-President Corazon Aquino of Republic Act 6734, and amended in 2001, paving the way for another plebiscite, which included Basilan and Marawi City, Lanao del Sur. Last year, the governor of Sulu filed a petition with the Supreme Court questioning the legality and constitutionality of the BOL. The Philippine Constitution Association also asked the high court to reject the BOL, saying the law violates the 1987 Constitution that mandated only one organic act for Muslim Mindanao. Oral arguments on the controversial law have been scheduled for next month. The Tan patriarch has urged Duterte to make good on his threat to establish a “revolutionary government,” so he could quickly reconfigure the country’s regions and shift to a federal form of government. “Only through federalism you can configure the territories that will constitute the federal states and not cluster only the laggards together like the five provinces in the ARMM. Now they say that [the BOL] it is also federalism [that will make only one region under the BOL], but it is not, it is an isolation, because it will only be constituted by five provinces that are laggards, so it is only through federalism that you can mix the laggards with the affluent, otherwise, these laggards will never progress.” “[To speed up] federalism, [we have to declare a] revolutionary government to make things easier. So [what happened was that it was immediately done by our] Constitution. So the President can now appoint members of the commission that will draft the new Constitution and then come up with the new government and then come up with the form of government that we will have. Instead of a unitary form of government then, we can have a parliamentary-federal system of government,” the elder Tan said, adding, “It is far better than creating a monster like the BOL.” Duterte, who has pushed a shift from presidential system of government to federal, has urged Muslims to ratify the BOL. During his visit to Cotabato City on January 18, Duterte told thousands of pro-MILF supporters: “Your approval of this law will not only serve as an expression of your desire to end more than half a century of armed struggle in the region. It will also serve testament of your determination to bring genuine peace and development in Muslim Mindanao to an autonomous government that truly represents and understands the needs of the people. Mga mahal kong (My dear) Moro brothers and sisters, Magboto kayo ng (Vote) Yes.” ARMM Gov. Mujiv Hataman, a strong advocate of the BOL, also urged his constituents to support the BOL and participate in the plebiscite. “The yes vote is a yes to our dreams. If there is a BOL, the Bangsamoro government will be freer to decide for itself. Apart from this, the BOL symbolizes the triumph of the peace process. If it is ratified, it becomes a clear message that conflict is over. The repetitive requests that we make to Manila will be reduced. Government services will be delivered faster,” he said. In Cotabato, Mayor Cynthia Sayadi, who is fighting the city’s inclusion in the proposed Bangsamoro region, said she received many reports that pro-BOL campaigners were harassing residents into voting for the ratification of the organic law. “I received harassment complaints from my people by Bangsamoro plebiscite campaigners. Number one is the abuses, abuses from the people who wanted the BOL to win in the city…all of those who are supporting the inclusion of [Cotabato in the Bangsamoro autonomous region], the Bangsamoro Organic Law,” the mayor added. “The city will reject the BOL and that is based on the consultations with the people, consultations with the different sectors and not just my voice, it is the voice of everyone that I consulted,” she said. “Cotabato is the seat of the ARMM government even though the city is not part of the Muslim autonomous region. And there were reports that Ebrahim and other rebel leaders — who took advantage of the peace process — have allegedly invested heavily in various businesses in Cotabato and that is why they wanted the city to be part of the expanded autonomous region,” she added. The same sentiments are also felt among residents in Isabela where Vice Mayor Cherryln Akbar is also leading the campaign against the city’s inclusion in the Bangsamoro autonomous region. She said the BOL would only benefit the MILF and its interest in the region. “Look at actor Robin Padilla who came here to campaign for the BOL. Why, is Robin Padilla from Isabela City, does he know the predicaments of the people here?” Akbar asked. She also took a swipe at lawmakers who approved the BOL. “If our children are sick, if we do not have rice on the table, do any of them congressmen come here to help us?” the mayor said. All the ARMM governors, except Tan, are campaigning for the BOL — Esmael Mangudadatu of Maguindanao, Jim Saliman of Basilan, Soraya Adiong of Lanao del Sur, and Rashidin Matba of Tawi-Tawi. The four politicians were all strong supporters of then President Benigno Aquino 3rd and defeated presidential candidate Manuel Roxas 2nd."
https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/14/19/key-rebel-stronghold-left-out-of-bangsamoro-territory,"Dozens of communities won approval to join a new Muslim-led territory in the Philippines' south, results showed Thursday, yet the exclusion of a key rebel stronghold raised concerns about the peace process in the restive region. The results are from the second and final round of a landmark referendum that was the culmination of a decades-long process seeking to halt Muslim separatist violence that has claimed some 150,000 lives since the 1970s. Voters had already overwhelmingly approved last month the so-called Bangsamoro region, which is centred on the island of Mindanao in the majority Catholic nation's south. Locals will have more control over their territory and see an influx of government cash for development projects aimed at breaking the cycle of poverty and violent extremism. The second round of voting on February 6 focused on whether a string of smaller communities would get approval from the municipality or region that surrounds them to join the Bangsamoro. Official results released Thursday by the Philippines' electoral commission showed 63 of 67 villages in the North Cotabato region would join. However, in an expected outcome, voters in the majority-Christian region of Lanao del Norte refused to allow six local towns to become part of the Bangsamoro. The result is that at least one major rebel camp belonging to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, whose peace deal with Manila prompted the vote, won't be inside the boundaries of the Bangsamoro. That is important because the rebels are supposed to lay down their arms and transition into leading the newly formed territory. Experts said it is unclear what impact the Lanao del Norte vote will have on long-term peace prospects as fighters under the MILF should still give up their weapons even outside the Bangsamoro. A key commander of those forces is also in line for a high-level job in the Bangsamoro's new government, which was widely seen as an effort to keep him and his troops in the fold. Still, Zachary Abuza, a security expert at the National War College in Washington, told AFP some fighters would surely be unhappy with the vote's result and could be a threat to peace. ""I think it's a very delicate situation,"" he said. ""If it's mishandled it could be bad."""
https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/15/19/excluded-lanao-del-norte-towns-may-still-benefit-from-new-bangsamoro-region-transition-body-member,"MANILA - Six towns in Lanao del Norte excluded from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) will still get to enjoy the benefits from the new region, a member of the Bangsamoro Transition Committee (BTC) said Friday. The municipalities of Baloi, Munai, Nunungan, Pantar, Tagoloan and Tangcal voted for the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) in the February 6 plebiscite but the province prevented its inclusion. ""Under the BOL, there is a provision that we can provide assistance to communities. There will be an office that would be set within the office of the chief minister that will cater to that particular issue,"" said BTC member Jose Lorena. In an interview on ANC's Early Edition Friday, Lorena said many from the said municipalities feel marginalized as they are deprived of some benefits from local government units. ""But Republic Act 11054 (the BOL) anticipated this, that is why there is a provision which will allow the Bangsamoro government to help and assist municipalities and local government units outside of the area in order to show that we have not abandoned our brothers who have been with us in the struggle for development and peace,"" Lorena said Lorena explained that Lanao del Norte's vote not to be included in the new Bangsamoro Autonomous Region may have been more of a political decision. ""The plebiscite is nearing election, there are political complications resulting from that. Many of those in favor are also running against the current officials of Lanao del Norte. Because of that, people are divided on political lines not really on the issue whether the joining of the 6 to the Bangsamoro is beneficial to the area or not,"" he said. Following the second round of the plebiscite on the BOL on Feb. 6, the 6 towns voted for the law but Lanao del Norte prevented its inclusion in the BARMM, while 63 of 67 villages in North Cotabato will be part of the new self-governed region. Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) leader Abdullah Macapaar, also known as Commander Bravo, (MILF) had campaigned hard for the inclusion of the said towns. The BOL, the enabling law of the 2014 peace pact between government and the MILF, was earlier ratified after majority in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and Cotabato City voted in favor of the law that would establish the BARMM. During the first round of the plebiscite on Jan. 21, a total of 1,540,017 residents voted for the law's ratification while 198,750 rejected the BOL, including 22,441 votes that made up the majority in Isabela City. Asked whether there may be complications from the exclusion of the 6 Lanao del Norte towns, Lorena said the MILF gave the assurance it would recognize the result of the plebiscite. ""I think the MILF leadership will also see to it that the areas covered by particularly the camps of Commander Bravo can reap the benefits of the Bangsamoro government so that they will not feel isolated, abandoned,"" he said. The MILF earlier nominated Macapaar to be part of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), an 80-member interim government that will run the new region until the first regular elections in 2022. ""Bringing in him to me is a good wise decision because he will now be articulating in the parliament rather than in the countryside,"" he said. The interim government will also include the 25-elected members of the current Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). ""I think the BTA would have to be appointed very soon so that we will not also be remiss in our performance,"" he said."

The results of Monday’s plebiscite show the law was ratified in the five-province, two-city Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and in Cotabato City. A Moro woman holds on to her child as she casts her vote in a polling precinct in Simuay Junction Central Elementary School in Simuay, Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao on January 21, 2019, day of the plebiscite for the Bangsamoro Law. MindaNews photo by MANMAN DEJETOIsabela City in Basilan rejected inclusion in the BARMM, as did Sulu, but Sulu will be part of the BARMM because the law provides that the ARMM votes as “one geographical area,” a provision the province questioned, among others, in its pending petition before the Supreme Court. The four other ARMM provinces voted “yes” – Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur including Marawi City, Basilan including Lamitan City, and Tawi-tawi. Out of a total of 1,980,441 registered voters in the ARMM, 1,540,017 voted “yes” (77.76%) while 198,750 voted “no” (10.04%). A total of 1,738,767 actually voted for a voter turnout of 87.80%. (Read: For now, BARMM is ARMM plus Cotabato City) On February 6, voters in Lanao del Norte’s six towns and in 67 villages in seven North Cotabato towns will troop to the polls to decide on their inclusion in the BARMM. But even if they say yes, they can be part of the BARMM only if their mother units – Lanao del Norte’s 16 other towns and the rest of the residents in the seven North Cotabato towns – also say yes. The National Plebiscite Board of Canvassers proclaimed RA 11054 or the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ratified on 25 January 2019, four years after the Mamasapano Tragedy that killed the chance for the Bangsamoro Basic Law to be passed.But how soon can the transition from ARMM to BARMM begin? Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Carlito Galvez, Jr., told MindaNews Friday night that on Monday, his office will submit to the Office of the President the list of 80 nominees for appointment to the 80-member Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA). Under the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB), the peace agreement signed by government and the MILF, the BTA which will be led by the MILF, will serve as the interim government until the first set of officials is elected on May 9, 2022 and the Bangsamoro government is inaugurated on June 30, 2022. The law vests the BTA with legislative and executive powers, the executive exercised by the interim Chief Minister who shall be appointed by the President, and the legislative by the BTA, also appointed by the President. The MILF’s nominee to the post of Chief Minister is MILF chair Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, who has been chair since late July 2003, after Salamat Hashim succumbed to an illness. Murad, who joined the revolutionary movement in 1969, first in the Moro National Libeation Front (MNLF) and later in the MILF, had earlier served as Vice Chair for Military Affairs and Chief of Staff of the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF), and concurrent MILF peace panel chair from 2001 to 2003. Murad told MindaNews they had submitted to Galvez’ office names of 41 people they are nominating to the BTA. Forty-one represents the simple majority in the BTA. During the transition period, the BTA exercises all powers and functions of the Bangsamoro Government as provided in RA 11054. The law mandates it to accomplish the following priority legislations during the transition: the Code of Parliamentary Rules and Procedures, Bangsamoro Administrative Code, Bangsamoro Tax and Revenue Code, Bangsamoro Electoral Code, Bangsamoro Local Government Code, Bangsamoro Education Code, Bangsamoro law for Indigenous Peoples, Bangsamoro Civil Service Code. The BTA is supposed to immediately take over from the ARMM officials after the law is ratified. But Congress inserted a provision – Section 5 — in Article XVI of RA 11054, providing for a transition to the BTA – a caretaker group – until the BTA is constituted, “to foreclose any political interregnum in the governance of the region.” The CAB does not provide for a caretaker group but Section 5 of RA 11054 provides that the caretakers will be composed of 45 members: the 25 elected ARMM officials and the 20 members of the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) that drafted the Bangsamoro Basic Law (the substitute bill filed by Congress is now RA 11054). The elected ARMM officials are the Governor, Vice Governor and 23 members of the Regional Legislative Assembly whose terms will end on June 30, 2019. A BTC member explained to MindaNews last year that Section 5 was proposed to avoid a vacuum if the appointment of BTA members is delayed. The fear of delays is not without a precedent. In the case of the 21-member BTC, the Executive Order creating it was issued on November 7, 2016 but it took the President three months – until February 10, 2017 — to name the 21-member BTC. (One of the 21 resigned at the height of the Marawi Siege in late May 2017). In addition to the 80-member BTA, the law provides that the 25 elected ARMM officials will also serve in the transition body until their terms expire on June 30, 2019. MILF-led, yes, but whose majority? The MILF as the signatory to the CAB, will lead the BTA as it did the BTC where it has 11 members, including the chair, Ghazali Jaafar, the MILF’s 1 st Vice Chair. The law provides that the MILF will lead the BTA “without prejudice to the participation of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in its membership.” The MNLF faction under Yusoph Jikiri and Muslimin Sema has three representatives in the BTC but MNLF founding chair Nur Misuari did not nominate anyone to represent his faction. Although assured of leadership in the BTA as it is the signatory to the CAB, the MILF may end up a minority in the caretaker government or even the BTA, at least until June 30. Moro Islamic Liberation Front Chairman Murad Ebrahim, using his real name Ahod “Murad” Balawag Ebrahim, votes for the first time in his life on January 21, 2019 during the plebiscite for the ratification of the Bangsamoro Law at the Simuay Junction Central Elementary School in Simuay, Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao. MindaNews photo by MANMAN DEJETOIn the 45-member caretaker government, the MILF has only 11 members – the 11 in the BTC. If the three MNLF representatives in the BTC are to be added to the MILF, that would be 14 which is just a third of the 45-member body. The majority is 23. If the BTA is constituted in February, as Murad says they hope it will be, the BTA will have 105 members – the 80 BTA appointees plus the 25 elected ARMM officials who will serve only until their terms end on June 30, 2019. The majority in the 105-member BTA (at least until June 30) is 53. After June 30, the simple majority would be 41 . Murad had earlier told MindaNews that they were asking Galvez’ office and the Presidential Management Staff which is vetting the nominees, to allow them to have additional nominees to ensure they are a majority in the BTA. “Sana ma reconsider nila because we have to maintain our majority number in the BTA,” Murad said. He said they hope the BTA would be constituted by February because the caretaker role is “not a functional government hindi kagaya ng BTA (unlike the BTA), it is a functional government.” (Carolyn O.

https://www.mindanews.com/peace-process/2019/02/bangsamoro-transition-authority-to-take-oath-feb-20-armm-to-barmm-turnover-on-feb-25/,"DAVAO CITY (MindaNews / 17 Feb) – The 80-member Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) will take their oath of office on February 20 in Malacanang on the same day of the “ceremonial confirmation” of the canvass results of the January 21 and February 6 plebiscite on RA 11054 or the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Malacanang has yet to announce the names of the 80 members of the BTA who will take their oath. The nominees have been vetted but “we do not know yet the final 80 members of the BTA,” Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Carlito Galvez told MindaNews late Saturday night. Thousands of supporters for the ratification of RA 11054 or the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao gather in the compound of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao on 18 January 2019 while President Rodrigo Duterte, who graced the Peace Assembly inside the Shariff Kabunsuan Cultural Complex, said a ‘yes’ to ratify the Bangsamoro law ends the 50-year armed struggle and marks a “new chapter in our history.” MindaNews photo by MANMAN DEJETOGalvez had earlier told MindaNews they were eyeing February 21 as the date but according to the invitation sent out by the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP), the oathtaking will be on February 20, at 4 p.m. at the Heroes Hall in Malacanang. The OPAPP has not formally announced the date of the oathtaking but Gerry Salapuddin, chair of the Southern Philippines Development Authority posted on his Facebook page on Saturday morning the OPAPP’s invitation to him. He also announced on his page the February 25 schedule of the turnover from ARMM to BARMM. Several other Moro leaders received the same invitation for February 20 from the OPAPP. Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, chair of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) told MindaNews on Saturday that they were informed Friday about the change in date from February 21 to February 20. The BTA will govern the Bangsamoro during the three-year transition period until June 30, 2022, when the first set of officials of the BARMM shall have been elected and taken their oath on the inauguration of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Murad is the MILF’s nominee for Chief Minister. The 80-member BTA headed by the Chief Minister will be appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte. In accordance with the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB), the peace agreement signed by government and the MILF on March 27, 2014, the BTA is to be led by the MILF. The MILF submitted a list of 41 nominees to the BTA while the OPAPP submitted a list of 39. The BTA oathtaking comes four days short of two years since the 21-member Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC), also led by the MILF, took their oath on February 24, 2017 in Davao City. The BTC was tasked to draft the Bangsamoro Basic Law. What is now RA 11054 is the substitute bill filed by the Bicameral Conference Committee of Congress. ARMM Governor Mujiv Hataman confirmed to MindaNews that February 25 is the turnover from ARMM to BARMM. “Yan initial arrangement with OPAPP,” he said.

The newly-ratified RA 11054 or the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao provides that the ARMM is deemed abolished upon its ratification and the BTA will serve as the transition government until 30 June 2022.

(Six years earlier, on February 25, 2013, then President Benigno Simeon Aquino III named the members of the then 15 member-BTC. The Aquino administration forged the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro in October 2012 and the CAB in March 2014 after 17 years of peace negotiations, but failed to pass the enabling law). Based on the results of the 2019 plebiscite, the BARMM is composed of the five-province, two-city, 116-town ARMM (Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-tawi and the cities of Marawi and Lamitan), plus Cotabato City and 63 villages in North Cotabato. Sulu voted “no” to the ratification but will still be part of the BARMM because the law provides that the ARMM votes as “one geographical unit.” Sulu has a pending petition before the Supreme Court to declare RA 11054 unconstitutional, citing various reasons, including the treatment of ARMM as one geographical area. Cotabato City Mayor Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi had earlier said they will file a protest on the conduct of the plebiscite in the city, alleging the MILF employed threats and intimidation. The MILF denied the allegations. On February 24, 2017 at the oathtaking of the BTC, Duterte told the commissioners: “Navigate the hindrances and obstructions. Hanapin ninyo ang daan hanggang patungo sa kapayapaan” (Find a way to peace). It will be difficult, he warned the BTC. “Mahirap ‘yan. It’s going to be a long journey but if there is a product that is acceptable to all, makikita ninyo ako” (I will be around), said Duterte, the 16th President of the Philippines and the first Mindanawon to lead the nation. He is also the first President to claim Moro roots. “Ang gusto ko talaga mangyari ay kapayapaan (What I really want is peace) but it must be as one country, one nation and one flag,” said Duterte, who had repeatedly vowed to address the historical injustices committed against the Bangsamoro people. President Rodrigo Duterte poses with the 21 members of the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) at the launch Friday, February 24, 2017 of the expanded body that will draft the Bangsamoro Basic Law. MindaNews photo by MANMAN DEJETOHe described himself as “a man in a hurry,” citing the threat of “extreme terrorism” of the Islamic State type. “We must avoid extremism or even entertaining or accommodating them because it will destroy all of us,” he said. Three months later, on May 23, 2017, the Marawi Siege began, plunging the country into a five-month war between government forces and the Islamic State-inspired Maute Group and its allies. Then Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza explained that the BTC would “craft a new draft of what would be another enabling law that will implement the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro but more than that, it will attempt also to converge all the different laws that we have in order that at the end of the day, we have only one Bangsamoro in a very enlightened Filipino nation.” The BTC had three representatives from the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). The MNLF forged two peace agreements with the government, in 1976 and 1996. Galvez early this month told a government radio interview that nine of the 80 BTA members will be coming from the MNLF. “As we re-launch the BTC today,” Murad said on February 24, 2017, “we rekindle the hope of thousands of our people for a peaceful and progressive Bangsamoro even if we are occasionally gripped by sadness at the failure earlier to pass the BBL.” He urged stakeholders to “look back at those experiences not with bitterness, but with an examining eye so that we may dissect the problems and address them.” “We must come out better prepared this time to respond to the challenges of legislation. The Filipino people must equally stand prepared to accept us as partners in achieving peace and progress, not only for this region but for the entire country,” Murad said. ( Carolyn O.

On its third week in office, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) has yet to inaugurate the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and hold the inaugural session of the Bangsmoro Parliament, a schedule that has been moved four times as its leaders await the availability of President Rodrigo Duterte. The BTA, the body that will govern the BARMM in the three-year transition period until noon of June 30, 2022, had actually decided during its caucus on March 9 that the inaugural will be on March 21, whether or not President Duterte would be present.

He confirmed his availability on March 25, Ebrahim said. BTA members were notified on March 15 that the inauguration will no longer be on March 21 but “Monday, March 25, with President Duterte.” Ebrahim informed the BTA during its caucus Tuesday (March 19) in Cotabato City, that the inauguration will be moved again to March 29 because that is when the President would be available. “Gusto ni PRRD (President Rodrigo Roa Duterte) mag-attend” (The President wants to attend), Ebrahim told MindaNews Tuesday night. He said they were earlier informed the date would be on March 25 but he received a message from the PMS on Monday that the President’s availability would be on March 29. A BTA member was reported to have said during the caucus that the BTA’s affairs “should not depend on the presence or attendance of the President.” Malacanang has so far released the appointment papers of 76 members out of the supposed 80-member MILF-led body. Of the 76 appointed, one passed away on March 13 – the MILF’s 1 st Vice Chair, Ghazali Jaafar, who was supposed to have been the Speaker of the Bangsamoro Parliament. Jaafar’s death leaves only 75 members. The MILF nominated 41 while the government is supposed to nominate 39.

Only Barangay Balatican out of the 23 proposed for inclusion voted “no.” The municipal hall of Pikit in North Cotabato, is part of Barangay Fort Pikit which is one of 22 barangays whose proposed inclusion in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) has been approved by majority of the voters in the town. Only 20 of Pikit’s 42 barangays will remain with North Cotabato. Mayor Sultan Sumulong says they will file a petition to have the municipal hall and the plaza be included in Barangay Poblacion instead, to allow what remains of Pikit to retain its town hall. MindaNews photo by MANMAN DEJETOThe 22 barangays that voted “yes” and whose proposed inclusion was approved by a majority of the voters in the entire town, include Rajah Muda, base of the Eastern Mindanao Front in Camp Rajah Muda, the third largest camp of the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF), the soon-to-be-decommissioned armed wing of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).

MIndaNews photo by MANMAN DEJETOThey also include Barangay Nabundas, the village of Mayor Sumulong Sultan and Barangay Fort Pikit, where the national historical landmark and the municipal hall on a hill are located. Sultan, who served as mayor from 2006 to 2013; returned as mayor in 2016 and is seeking reelection under President Rodrigo Duterte’s Partido ng Demokratikong Pilipino-Laban (PDP-Laban), told MindaNews Thursday that only one out the 23 proposed for inclusion in the BARMM, will remain with Pikit. But lawyer Omar Sema, a Commissioner of the Bangsamoro Transition Commission manifested before the Municipal Plebiscite Board of Canvassers that they will file a petition to declare a failure of plebiscite in Balatican, claiming there was “no free election because of threats and intimidation.” Sema told MindaNews that voters shied away from the polls because of threats and intimidation from the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)-Nur Misuari faction.

MindaNews photo by MANMAN DEJETOIn an earlier interview, Sultan told MindaNews that he goes with the President’s pronouncements that the Bangsamoro law will be good for everyone. “Ganon si President … ganon na rin sa akin. Makakabuti yun sa kanila … Alam natin kanilang theme is maganda, para sa kapayapapan, para sa kaunlaran ng Bangsamoro. Mahirap naman mag-against tayo doon kasi gusto na nila mamuno so bigyan na natin sila ng time, ng pagkakataon na maka-autonomy sila.” (That’s what the President said … I’d say the same. It will be good for them ….We know the theme is good, for peace, for progress of the Bangsamoro. It’s difficult if we go against them because they want to govern so let’s give them the time, the chance to have their autonomy).” Sultan is willing to be mayor of a town very much less than its original size and population, and therefore, very much less its current 300 million pesos internal revenue allotment (IRA). The IRA is based, among others, on land area and population. “Gusto natin magserbisyo. Pero ito siempre, ang importante ang kabutihan ng BARMM” (I want to serve. But of course what is important is what will be good for the BARMM). The interest of the majority, not self-interest, should be served, he said, adding, “ang importante makuha ang minimithi ng Bangsamoro” (What is important is we get what the Bangsamoro aspires for). BARMM but still vote NorthCot in May Sultan said the separation from Pikit of barangays that will go to BARMM will not be immediate. As registered voters in North Cotabato, residents of the villages who will go to the BARMM will still vote for municipal officials of Pikit, officials of the province and congressional district because their cluster-of- villages-for-BARMM will not likely be constituted into a municipality or merged with neighboring Maguindanao towns or villages, before the May 13, 2019 elections.

The results show that 22 barangays will join the BARMM while 20 will remain with Pikit. MindaNews photo by MANMAN DEJETORA 11054 provides that the Bangsamoro Parliament “may create, divide, merge, abolish, or substantially alter boundaries of municipalities or barangays in accordance with a law enacted by the Parliament.” But even granting that the BTA will be constituted this month as MILF chair Al Haj Murad Ebrahim hopes, it will still not be able to attend to the creation a new town or merge it with contiguous barangays in Maguindanao before the May elections because it has yet to pass its own Bangsamoro Local Government Code. RA 11054 mandates the BTA to accomplish these “priority legislations”: the Code of Parliamentary Rules and Procedures, Bangsamoro Administrative Code, Bangsamoro Tax and Revenue Code, Bangsamoro Electoral Code, Bangsamoro Local Government Code, Bangsamoro Education Code, Bangsamoro law for Indigenous Peoples, Bangsamoro Civil Service Code.

Colony no. 1 was composed of 120 colonists who were given lands in the villages of Ladtingan, Calawag, Ginatilan, Panicupan, Manding and Inug-ug . Five more colonies were set up in 1914 and 1915 in Paidu Pulangui, Silik, Makasendeg, Pagalungan and Talitay. Panicupan and Makasendeg are among the 22 barangays that will be part of the BARMM. Nabundas, the village of Mayor Sultan, is also one of the 22.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/01/25/19/after-bangsamoro-organic-law-is-ratified-now-comes-the-hard-part,"Muslim women pray during a campaign rally supporting the Bangsamoro Organic Law. Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News MANILA/COTABATO CITY—Hotel taxi service driver Tong Saluguinan is sick of the gunfights and killings in Mindanao, a southern Philippine area that, for nearly half a century, became a battleground not only between government troops and Moro rebels, but also of warring political clans and their private armed groups. This is why in a plebiscite in Cotabato on Monday, January 21, Saluguinan voted “yes” to a law that will create a new region promising greater autonomy to the restive homeland of the Philippine Muslim minority. Based on the final and official plebiscite results, the ""yes"" votes won in Cotabato City, which means it will now be included in new Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), along with present Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, where the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) was overwhelmingly ratified. Only Isabela City in Basilan rejected inclusion in the new BARMM. Some 600,000 people in North Cotabato and Lanao del Norte areas will decide on February 6 whether to join, too. The victory is a hard-fought dream paid with the blood of all Moros who fought in their struggle for a homeland. “We’re all so sick of that [fighting],” Salunguinan said in Filipino, as he recalled the time more than 20 years ago, when he was armed with guns as a member of the country’s largest Moro rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), formed in the 1970s to resist the martial law regime and advance the cause of Moro separatism. “There was a time when soldiers surprised our group with an attack in a camp near Ampatuan town. It was very early in the morning and we were still wearing our malong (traditional tube garment). We ran as they threw explosives at us. Two of my fellow fighters were hit. They were thrown off by the impact and ended up hanging on a tree,” Salunguinan added. Hotel taxi service driver Tong Saluguinan poses for a photo after an interview with ABS-CBN News. Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News Tired of bloodshed, Saluguinan left the underground movement in 2000 and went to Manila a year later to find a job. He went back to Cotabato a decade later to settle with his family. Saluguinan was among 36,600 people in Cotabato who voted for the Bangsamoro law, while 24,900 others voted “no.” The city, which rejected joining the current ARMM in two previous plebiscites, will join the new BARMM despite the opposition of its mayor, Cynthia Guiani. “I feel really good. The moment I heard ‘yes’ won, I thought this should trigger change for some of the rowdy people here . . . That should be a priority because some of the Bangsamoro people here are hot-headed, they need discipline. They shouldn’t act that way just because we won the plebiscite. We need to change gradually,” Saluguinan said, referring to some of his fellow Filipino Muslims in the city. A woman brings her child in a polling precinct in Cotabato City as she casts her vote for the Bangsamoro Organic Law. Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News New struggle for an old rebel leader The Moro rebellion began in the late 1960s when massacres by paramilitary groups, seemingly backed by the government at that time, left many Filipino Muslims in Lanao and Sultan Kudarat areas dead. Al-Hajj Murad Ebrahim, leader of the MILF, was already in the underground movement at the onset of that revolution. “The struggle of the Bangsamoro, basically, is a political struggle for our rights for self-determination. Even before the colonial period ay nakipaglaban na kami sa colonizers. We wanted to sustain our independence as a nation. But unfortunately, we didn’t succeed,” he told ABS-CBN News in an interview at the MILF stronghold, Camp Darapanan, a day after the January 21 plebiscite. That struggle, Murad explained, began ages ago with the inclusion of their land under the Philippine Republic without the consent of the Bangsamoro people. Although the Moros embrace their Filipino identity today, the dream of governing their own land according to their own set of customs, systems, and beliefs, had remained unfulfilled, Murad added. While people in the different Philippine islands and the Bangsamoro south have their own struggles, all of them faced a common adversity when then President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. declared a nationwide martial law. “In 1972, when President Marcos declared martial law, the situation worsened for the Moros. The atrocities were all out there, and we saw the military behind it. At first, there will be these groups, but it appears the government was supporting this because we saw the Philippine Constabulary with them,” Murad said. Murad was only 19 when he joined the underground movement in 1968, dropping out of Notre Dame College in Cotabato City when he was just a year away from finishing a degree in civil engineering. This caused a fissure in his relationship with his older brother, who was paying for his studies back then. MILF Chairman Al Hajj Murad Ebrahim during a one-on-one interview with ABS-CBN News. Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN news “He didn’t talk to me for one or two years,” Murad recalled. While Murad is now able to smile remembering that time, what happened to him in the battlefield is no laughing matter, especially the hardships and sacrifices — including near-death experiences and friends lost — during the time of war. “We defended this very area for 4 years during the height of the fighting in 1974. We only ate bananas. There were so many sacrifices, two of my training batchmates died in battle. I barely survived when splinters from an air attack hit me. There was even a time when my group was surrounded by the Armed Forces of the Philippines. We waited until night and in the dark we tried to slip,” he said. Murad was initially a member of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) led by Nur Misuari, but he later joined Hashim Salamat in the 1980s to form the MILF when the two factions failed to agree on how to implement the 1976 Tripoli Agreement, a historic deal that gained the support of all Moros and member-states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation at that time. The rebellion persisted for decades until the MILF, then led by Murad, struck a landmark peace deal with the government, headed by President Benigno Aquino III in 2014. After several setbacks, the new Bangsamoro Organic Law was passed by Congress and signed by President Rodrigo Duterte only in 2018. Now 70, Murad is no longer an armed fighter. The former rebel leader said he spends a lot of his free time with his 9 grandchildren, who he said are “closer to me than their parents.” Being a grandfather, he said, lightens up the burden as he faces the challenge of leading a transitional government for 3 years to carry the Bangsamoro people into a new era of self-rule. The autonomous Bangsamoro government will be parliamentary-democratic, similar to the United Kingdom, and based on a political party system. It will put the MILF leaders on the same policy-making field with the powerful political clans in Muslim Mindanao. An analyst said the setup could be challenging. “A genuine political party system means the clan will not vanish. You will put clans in a situation where there are new rules of the game, which are more democratic, equitable, fair play, and no violence,” political analyst Ramon Casiple said, adding that this is an opportunity for the Bangsamoro to establish a political party system that may even be better than what is being practiced in Philippine Congress. Murad acknowledged that dealing with influential political families, which usually have private armed groups, in a parliament would be difficult, but he is optimistic that the political party system of the Bangsamoro government will focus less on individual politics and diminish somehow the power of local clans. “It’s a fight between political parties, not individual parties. We reduced this to party politics. In individual politics, only the popular personalities win. That is the reason why we have actors turned politicians, and the reason why only the rich people are able to win elections. But this one is political party politics. The strongest political party will dominate,” Murad said. MILF Chairman Al Hajj Murad Ebrahim votes for the first time in his life during the plebiscite for the Bangsamoro Organic Law. Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News The Bangsamoro parliament will have 80 seats, wherein 50 percent is allotted to political parties not exclusive to the MILF, meaning parties of other groups such as the MNLF will also have a chance to be represented. About 40 percent of the seats in the parliament will be allotted to district representatives, and about 10 percent for Christians, Lumad, and other sectors. Unlike the national government, which changes every 6 years, the Bangsamoro parliament will have continuity as only the officials and the number of seats held by political parties will change every election, said Murad. “When it is a political party, if the party is maintained, even if the officials sitting in the parliament change, the program remains, and it cannot be changed by one man alone. The program will be there and that will be continuous. Even if the party is not that strong, it will still be part of the government, and it will struggle to push its programs,” he said. The MILF leader said he is confident that his group is big enough to have a strong voice in parliament, and that although it will face different sectors and parties in the lawmaking body, it can convince them to support its agenda if it is for the benefit of all people in the Bangsamoro land, regardless of their affiliation. Next-gen Moros to lead new Bangsamoro gov’t Instead of training for combat operations, the youth of the MILF are now being trained to become future leaders of the Bangsamoro government. Murad said the old members of the group have done their part, and they want the next generation to take over in the next chapter of their struggle. According to Murad, for the past 5 years, they have been sending some 200 young MILF members, usually fresh college graduates, to leadership trainings in Japan, Malaysia, Turkey and Europe. These young leaders will be members of the MILF’s political party, and some of them may one day win a seat in parliament. “During the start of the revolution, we really mobilized our youth to fight. But now that we’re here in the negotiation, there is a promise. We started training our youth so they can really develop. For us, we’ve done our part already so the next generation will take over,” Murad said, adding that they have also established a leadership institution in the MILF. Kids play inside the compound of Cotabato City's Grand Mosque. Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News It’s not just the MILF members gearing up for the change that will soon take over their land. Young Moros in Muslim Mindanao are also preparing for the Bangsamoro government, hoping they can participate, in any capacity, in efforts to make their hometown, which has been seen as a security hotspot for along time, a better and a more peaceful place for everyone. “Being a youth here, we need to be ready because the elders are doing what they can for us young ones,” said 24-year-old Ilham Lagantao after voting “yes” for Bangsamoro in Sultan Kudarat town in Maguindanao. She is optimistic that her first time to exercise her right to suffrage will result in gains not only for her fellow Moros but also for her Christian and Lumad friends. While the struggle of the Bangsamoro people was anchored on the aspirations for self-determination, there is no denying that they are not the only natives of Muslim Mindanao, Murad said. He said Moros should accept this reality of sharing their homeland with Christians, Lumad, and even migrants from different places in the Philippines. This is why the MILF leader said several provisions have been placed in the Bangsamoro Organic Law to ensure that the rights of non-Muslims in the region will be respected and their voices heard by the new government. He vowed that everyone, regardless of religion or sector, would feel the benefits of having an autonomous government. “There are several provisions in the BOL and the agreement, that the rights of the non-Muslim, the migrants, the IPs [indigenous people] are well-entrenched and respected. The decision was a compromise, so despite the fact that we were fighting for the Bangsamoro, we also have to accept that other people in the area have their own rights we have to respect,” Murad said.

Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News In a predominantly Catholic Christian country, the Philippine Muslim minority is a majority in the ARMM. A 2015 report by the Philippine Statistics Authority shows Moros account for about 91 percent of the population in the region, with Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao having the highest number of Muslims. “This is the first time in the country that minorities will be represented in the government. If you look at the national [level], you don’t see any representatives of the minority. Here, they are all well-represented. They have seats in the parliament. The benefits of the Bangsamoro will be the same for non-Muslims and indigenous peoples,” Murad said. Fighting corruption is Bangsamoro’s first real struggle Murad said he sees new highways and airports rising in Muslim Mindanao once the three-year transition period he will lead ends. His initial plans include building a major coastal road stretching some 200 kilometers from Datu Odin Sinsuat town to the Lanao del Norte areas, a road more than twice the length of the North Luzon Expressway in Manila. He said placing “strategic infrastructure” across the Bangsamoro region is doable with the help of the 5-percent block grant from the national internal revenue agency and Customs collections, and the 10-year, P50-billion special fund allotted for the new autonomous government to help them catch up in development. The 5-percent block grant for the Bangsamoro region is pegged at P67 billion, which is more than twice as much as the P32-billion highest budget received by the 29-year-old ARMM, said Murad. But he emphasized the first struggle for the new government is to make sure these funds will not end up in the pockets of corrupt officials. A vendor waits for more customers in a market in Cotabato City. Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News “The corruption rate in our place is very high. The amount of appropriated budget will have no bearing if we will not be able to counter corruption. Everything will just lead to nowhere. That is the first struggle that we need to solve,” Murad said, adding that one of the root causes of corruption in the ARMM is its weak auditing system. He said one of the “weapons” against corruption placed in the organic law is the “double auditing” system, wherein the region’s funds will go through both the national and Bangsamoro government’s auditing offices. Murad earlier told foreign reporters in a press conference that self-rule will be difficult, because “maybe our enemy will be ourselves.” Prospects of lasting peace in Mindanao Controlling loose guns and disbanding private armed groups in Mindanao, where “anybody can just buy weapons,” is part of the MILF’s shared responsibilities with the national government under the peace pact, and Murad believes this will be one long process that will require patience and effort from the policy-makers. Decades of armed struggle and the presence of private armies in Muslim Mindanao, which poses threats even to civilians, have made owning guns a necessity for survival in the southern Philippines, and only an effective security structure that can be trusted by residents will be able to address the issue, Murad added. “The people will not let go of their firearms. They see the need to hold guns for survival. That’s why the joke here is, it is better to separate with your wife rather than your firearms. It means the people are very concerned. If there is an effective security structure, it will be OK. To be frank, people right now do not fully trust the PNP and AFP yet . . . This is a very long struggle,” he said. Children enjoy playing by a pool of water near the Grand Mosque in Cotabato City. Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News The MILF leader said they will immediately give up a third of their firearms upon the ratification of the organic law, which is part of the peace process. He said the remaining firearms will be used by a joint peace and security team, composed of members of the Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines and the group’s armed wing, the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF). “This joint peace security teams will be composed of the non-decommissioned BIAF members, then the PNP and the AFP. This may address the issue of loose firearms. We can also open for licensing because that’s what other countries are doing. As long as there is control first, because we cannot put everything in place until there is no effective security structure,” Murad said. He added that MILF combatants will become civilians after the decommissioning process. Former fighters will have a chance to apply for the PNP and AFP but the Bangsamoro government will try to provide social packages for those who no longer wish to do so or for those who will not be accommodated by the national security forces, he added. Asked how the new Bangsamoro government will address the problem of violent extremism in Mindanao, Murad said dialogues will be held with other armed groups, such as the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, a breakaway group of the MILF, and the Abu Sayyaf Group, a splinter group of the MNLF. Murad is confident these groups can be convinced to lay down their arms and help the new Bangsamoro government because the root of their cause is “frustration” with previously unimplemented peace pacts with the government. These groups, he said, have little money, which is why they resort to kidnapping and funding from international extremist groups. “If we will be successful, this will gradually fade because the people will be supporting the Bangsamoro government. Before, they are seen as heroes; now, they will appear as saboteurs. Nobody wants conflict. We have to open the option by showing to them and by having dialogues with them. Of course if this won’t work, the security structure will address this,” he said. Asked how his group would deal with possible frustrations with the new Bangsamoro government, given that addressing the problems of the region will be a long process, Murad said they can only offer transparency. He earlier said he wants the Bangsamoro struggle to be a lesson of peace, especially to other countries that have similar conflicts. “We revolutionaries, although we resorted to armed struggle, but then, we have always seen the solution to the problem is peace. The important thing is we do not close our doors for peace because war is not a solution. The solution is still peace,” he said in a press conference after exercising his right to suffrage for the first time last January 21."

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1048310/sulu-lgu-asks-sc-to-junk-unconstitutional-bangsamoro-law,"Sulu capitol building in Jolo town. INQUIRER FILE / REM ZAMORA The province of Sulu, represented by Gov. Abdusakur Tan II, is questioning the legality of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) in a petition for certiorari and prohibition filed before the Supreme Court (SC). The petition dated October 11, 2018, is asking the SC to issue a temporary restraining order on Republic Act 11054, or the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (BAR) in Muslim Mindanao, as it is allegedly not allowed under the 1987 Constitution. ADVERTISEMENTAccording to Tan, the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Commission on Elections, the Bangsamoro Transition Commission, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, Peace Adviser Jesus Dureza, and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) committed grave abuse of discretion because it effectively abolished the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), which was created through a provision in the Constitution. “The enactment of R.A. 11054 violates Section 18 and Section 19, Article X of the Constitution, because the Constitution authorizes the enactment of only one (1) Organic Act upon the establishment of the autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao,” the petition claimed. “Furthermore, since ARMM was created by the Constitution, Congress, by itself, cannot abolish ARMM; only through a constitutional amendment may ARMM be abolished. R.A. 11054 which effectively abolishes ARMM is, therefore, unconstitutional,” it added R.A. 11054 was signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte on July 28, 2018, and took effect on August 10, 2018. Sulu’s petition falls within the 60-day period allowed to question recently-passed laws. The document, prepared by former Comelec Commissioner Sixto Brillantes, also said that if the BAR adopts a parliamentary form of government, it would turn the executive and the legislative branches into one body, thus violating current laws. “In Section 3, Article IV, and in Article VII of R.A. 11054, the establishment of a parliamentary form of government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region violates the doctrine of separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution,” they said. “The Chief Minister is not elected as such by the people, but as Member of Parliament, and subsequently elected as Chief Minister by Parliament. Not being directly elected by the people, he does not directly represent the people but the Parliament which elected him. This is unconstitutional,” they noted. The BOL, originally called the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), is believed to be the answer to decades-long armed conflict in the southern provinces of the country. It was initiated during the administration of former President Benigno Aquino III, but failed to gain traction after 44 members of the police’s Special Action Force were killed by MILF members in an operation in Mamasapano, Maguindanao, in January 2015. ADVERTISEMENTWhen President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office in 2016, he urged the Congress to pass the BBL. Days before his third State of the Nation Address (Sona), the Bicameral Conference Committee approved the proposal, with key revisions to its name and the proposed preamble. /cbb Don't miss out on the latest news and information.

And we'd like to thank Senator [Franklin] Drilon, Senator [Aquilino] ""Koko"" Pimentel [III], Senator Joel Villanueva as well as the House panels who actively participated in the approval of this particular article,"" said Zubiri. Shari'ah or Islamic law is the law forming part of the Islamic tradition derived from religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Qur'an and the Hadith. Section 7, Article 10 of the proposed BBL takes it a notch higher by creating the Shari'ah High Court, which shall have jurisdiction over the following: The Bangsamoro Shari'ah High Court would have exclusive appellate jurisdiction over cases handled by Shari'ah district courts in the Bangsamoro. The document, however, also states ""nothing contained [in the BBL] shall affect the original and appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as provided in the constitution."" The Shari'ah High Court would be composed of 5 justices, including a presiding justice. A person can only be a Shari'ah High Court justice if he or she is a Muslim, a natural-born Filipino at least 40 years old, and with 15 years of experience in law – with two of those years involving Shari'ah or Islamic jurisprudence. The same requirements apply to people who wish to be Shari'ah circuit or district court judges, except for the age. Shari'ah court judges should be at least 30 years old, while district court judges should be at least 35. If passed into law, the BBL's provisions over the Shari'ah would only apply to cases involving Muslims. The Islamic law may also be applied to non-Muslims should they volunteer to submit to the jurisdiction of the Shari'ah courts. Article 10 also states that traditional or tribal laws would only be applicable to disputes of indigenous peoples within the Bangsamoro. – Rappler.com"

Mr. Kiram was buried on Monday in an ancestral graveyard on Jolo Island in the Sulu Archipelago. Though he claimed the title of sultan of Sulu, several other descendants of the original sultan, who lived in the 15th century, make the same claim. Before Spanish colonizers arrived in the 16th century, the sultanate of Sulu ruled over vast stretches of territory, including parts of what is now the southern Philippines and Borneo. Mr. Kiram, who was born on Nov. 9, 1939, in Maimbung, the Philippines, issued a directive for the descendants of the original sultan to unite in the peaceful pursuit of the sultanate’s historical claim to the part of Borneo that borders the southern Philippines and is now owned by Malaysia, Mr. Idjirani said in a text message. Mr. Kiram’s younger brother, Phugdal Kiram, was named the new sultan, he said. With the support of Mr. Kiram, the previous sultan, Jamalul Kiram III, ordered several hundred fighters to invade the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo in 2013 to reclaim the area for the sultanate and for the Philippines. The attack left more than 60 people dead, set off the most serious security crisis in Malaysia in more than a decade and strained the country’s relationship with the Philippines. The sultanate’s claim to parts of Borneo is based on past control over the area, and the Philippine government has said repeatedly that it continues to study the issue and has not given up on the claim. The Kirams say Sabah was leased to Malaysia. Malaysian officials contend that, in exchange for lease payments to the Kirams, the sultanate ceded the territory to their country. Over the years, the once powerful sultanate of Sulu has lost influence to other groups, becoming essentially a symbolic organization, said Richard Javad Heydarian, a political science professor at De La Salle University in Manila. “As the botched Sabah operation showed, their political influence is very limited,” he said. The Philippine government signed a landmark peace agreement in 2012 with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest Muslim separatist group in the country. The smaller Moro National Liberation Front, which is allied with some of the descendants of the sultan of Sulu, was largely left out of the peace talks. Other factions on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao have replaced the political power of the sultanate, Mr. Heydarian said. “Mindanao has gradually moved to a postsultanate era, which is dominated by rebels, warlords and modern warfare,” he said."
https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/05/22/1585642/no-bbl-next-congress-focus-federalism,"MANILA, Philippines – The incoming 17th Congress will not tackle the controversial Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), which outgoing lawmakers have tried but failed to pass, according to Davao del Norte Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez. Alvarez, who is the choice for speaker of incoming president Rodrigo Duterte, yesterday said the BBL would be subsumed by the planned shift to the federal form of government that the Duterte administration would prioritize. He said the BBL would give way to federalism “because they are the same concept.” “While waiting for federalism, the Duterte administration can fully implement the Tripoli Agreement,” he said. The Tripoli accord led to the establishment of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Alvarez said ARMM would function better and prosper under a federal system. “They can manage their own natural resources and economy,” he said. The draft BBL is the product of peace negotiations between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Alvarez accused the Aquino administration of “taking the MILF for a ride” because it agreed to certain provisions in the draft BBL that “were unconstitutional.” The bloody encounter in January 2015 between commandos of the Philippine National Police Special Action Force and Muslim guerillas mostly belonging to the MILF stalled congressional consideration of the proposed BBL. However, the MILF has blamed Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who chairs the Senate committee on local government, for the failure of Congress to pass the measure. The MILF claimed that Marcos did not have the time for the draft BBL in the latter part of 2015, as he was already busy preparing for his vice presidential run. Marcos denies the accusation, tossing the blame to the administration and its allies in the House of Representatives. Reached for comment on Alvarez’s statement that the draft BBL would be shelved, reelected ARMM Gov. Mujiv Hataman said it does not augur well for peace in Mindanao. “It sends the wrong message to the MILF and those of us who want to resolve the decades-old conflict in Mindanao so that peace and development could finally be attained,” he said. He said party-list group Anak Mindanao, which his wife heads and which has won two seats in the House, will re-file the proposed BBL at the start of the term of the next Congress. Hataman also foresees a problem with ARMM under a federal system if regions or states would be entirely autonomous and would be required to generate their own finances. He said the Muslim region would receive this year about P30 billion in subsidy from the national government. “The annual income of ARMM is very much less than that. If ARMM will not get subsidy from the central government, it will become poorer. The same will be true with other poor and underdeveloped regions,” he stressed. In a related development, senator-elect Sherwin Gatchalian urged the incoming administration to study federalism “holistically to be able to come up with the best form.” Like Hataman, the neophyte senator said a wrong approach would make rich areas richer and poor areas poorer because of uneven income distribution.

https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/10/1601334/duterte-concede-bbl-if-federalism-bid-fails,"MANILA, Philippines - A Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) in place is good enough for President Duterte if federalism fails to gather enough support. “I foresee that towards the end of the year, we’d be able to come up with the framework (on) federalism. But if the Filipino nation and a plebiscite would not want it, then I am ready to concede (to) whatever is there in the BBL,” Duterte said at Friday’s Hariraya festival in Davao City. The stance, he said, would ensure that Muslims in Mindanao get their share when the territories in the country are redefined. He said his administration is working on a framework where everyone is represented, including those from the left and the right of center. In talking about a reconfiguration of boundaries, Duterte said the areas in Mindanao that are mostly populated by the Tausug people and often associated with Moro National Liberation Front founder Nur Misuari might also have to be divided. “We will have new boundaries and these boundaries do not really intend to separate our brother Moro from the Christian. Rather, it is intended only to delineate territories. But that should not keep us apart from being Mindanaoans,” Duterte said. Although separated by religious beliefs, he added Muslims could not entirely drive Christians out of their lands as many have become closely related to one another. “So, let us accept each other. Let us build a nation that will be founded on peace and understanding,” the President said. Any reconfiguration of boundaries, he emphasized, will not come overnight. “Certainly, it will not come next year. Probably, it will be something about two to three years from now. But I assure you that something will change before I end my term,” he stressed. Presumptive Senate president Aquilino Pimentel III, for his part, said limitations to the full implementation of the decentralization measures under the Local Government Code of 1991 hinder the delivery of basic services like health care and education by local governments. Abbin Dalhani, PDP-Laban National Capital Region council president, said under the current unitary government structure, government authority and function are focused on the national capital, to the detriment of those in the provinces. Speaking at a forum in Manila yesterday, former Senate president Aquilino Pimentel Jr. made another pitch for federalism, saying it would give local governments “greater powers, much more than what was envisioned in the Local Government Code.” He said he had hoped that under the Local Government Code he authored and steered to enactment in 1991, “overconcentration of powers to the central government in Manila would be reduced.” He recalled that it happened with the devolution of the functions of the Departments of Agriculture, Health and Social Welfare and Development that are all part of the central government, to local government units. But he also mentioned the downside of the law, like when the DSWD had to bear the burden of delivering services in the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda in 2013, when local governments “should have known better.” The former senator proposes that under a federal form of government, federal states should benefit from government income as 80 percent of all forms of state revenues, including taxes, would be divided among federal states. Currently, local governments are entitled to internal revenue allotments (IRA). Pimentel also proposed 11 states to be formed under a federal government, patterned after the current regional and language boundaries. For Luzon, it will be composed of Northern Luzon (Ilocos, Cagayan and Cordillera regions), Central Luzon, Southern Tagalog (the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) and Bicol. Four states will be formed in the Visayas with slight changes, namely: Eastern Visayas (Samar and Leyte provinces); Central Visayas (the present region plus Masbate); Western Visayas (Ilonggo provinces); Mimaropa (the present Region 4-B). Mindanao will be composed of the states of Northern Mindanao (Zamboanga and Northern Mindanao regions), Southern Mindanao (Davao, SOCCSKSARGEN and Caraga regions) and the Bangsamoro state (the present Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao). Metro Manila, meanwhile, will be the federal capital. Under a federal government, Pimentel said that up to six senators would represent each federal state, including Metro Manila. Also, the three branches of government will be distributed across the country, with the executive branch situated in Metro Manila, the legislature in the Visayas and the judiciary in Mindanao.
